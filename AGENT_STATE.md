**Branch:** main
**Hive-mind mode:** ACTIVE (W4 closed; wind-down pending)

## Session summary

### cycle-14-v1-1-w4-ui-wiring-chain-t4 (2026-05-30)

**Dispatch:** `agentic_orchestration/dispatches/2026-05-30-drax-cycle-14-v1-1-w4-ui-wiring-chain-t4.md` — completion record appended
**Authority:** Matt 2026-05-30 follow-on verbatim "wire in T4 nodes...emit the hidden secondary T4" (via gandalf consolidated follow-on Stage 2); auto-commit + auto-push per cycle authorization
**Build:** 1037 modules, 0 TS errors. Tests: 81/81 PASS

**Disc #11 empirical inspection (pre-execution):**
- Spot-checked `ashwind_ember_scout.json` (chain_wide_parallel, 2 candidates) and `stonecaller_of_the_fractured_reach.json` (CHAIN_WIDE_OWN, 0 candidates, primary_t4 present).
- Schema confirmed: chain_composition {t4_chains, supporting_chains, total_chains}, class_chain_count, t4_scope, t4_candidates[], primary_t4 {strategy, magnitude, applied_to, scope, discipline_anchor}. Matches MIGRATION.md §v1.69 description exactly. No refutation triggered.

**New TypeScript types (types.ts):**
- `ChainComposition`, `T4Candidate`, `PrimaryT4` interfaces added
- New optional fields on `ClassData`: `chain_composition?`, `class_chain_count?`, `t4_scope?`, `t4_candidates?`, `primary_t4?`

**New component:**
- `src/components/Cycle14/Cycle14T4Panel.tsx` — dual-mode (loadout/sample):
  - Chain composition structural summary (t4_chains / supporting_chains / total)
  - Primary T4 fixed universal slot (non-toggleable; Discipline #39 scaffold surfaced)
  - Layer 2 T4 Loadout mode: radio-button D66 per doc 40 § 8.3.1 (one active at a time)
  - Layer 2 T4 Sample mode: AS-gauntlet-passed active read-only (no toggle per doc 49 § 1.2)
  - CHAIN_WIDE_OWN empty-state: doc 47 § 4.6.4 anchored copy — NOT "coming soon"

**Page updates:**
- `Loadout.tsx`: import Cycle14T4Panel, render after gear section with mode="loadout"
- `Sample.tsx`: import Cycle14T4Panel + Cycle14GearDisplay (W2 render path gap — Sample was still using GearGrid; upgraded to gear_representative when present); render T4 panel with mode="sample"

**Render path decisions:**
- Layer 2 T4 toggle: radio-button group with `role="radiogroup"` aria attribute; each candidate card is clickable in loadout mode, non-interactive in sample mode
- Primary T4 player-facing copy: "Direct Damage Amplification 1.75× preferred encounter type · universal" + Discipline #39 scaffold note (Cycle 15 retirement)
- CHAIN_WIDE_OWN copy (Loadout): "No Layer 2 T4 unlocks — this kit's T4 capability is provided by the Primary T4 universal guarantee alone. Canonically complete at v1.1 per doc 47 § 4.6.4."
- CHAIN_WIDE_OWN copy (Sample): "No Layer 2 T4 — gauntlet passed via Primary T4 universal guarantee alone. Canonically complete at v1.1 per doc 47 § 4.6.4."
- Component is null-safe for pre-v1.69 seasons (returns null when no chain_composition OR primary_t4)

**Commit:** `51c6e83`

### cascade-r4-v1-season-002-marquee-polish-1 (2026-05-30)

**Dispatch:** `agentic_orchestration/dispatches/2026-05-29-drax-cycle-14-season-002-marquee-reshape.md` — completion record appended
**Authority:** Matt 2026-05-29 verbatim correction: "quality of all group photos are very poor"; cascade-r4 v1 close polish; auto-commit + auto-push
**Build result:** tsc clean + vite clean (1036 modules, 0 TS errors)

**Problem:** First-pass group portraits (commit ca29dfa) were poor quality — constructed from drax-self-authored prompts without legolas authored prompts or galadriel design guidance (those files landed after first-pass executed).

**Re-roll — Phase 2 (Step 1):**
- Source: legolas authored prompts from `agentic_orchestration/legolas/notes/2026-05-29-cycle-14-season-002-marquee-image-gen-prompts.md` (178-192 words each; HD-2D; D7 compliant)
- Design guidance: galadriel §1 group composition designs applied — tri-band palette (Stormcallers), 5-7 member representative subset (Ironsoil), wind-primary anchoring + broken-cloud lighting (Gale-Blessed), dispersed-depth + shadow-thread tendrils (Duskchain)
- Upgrade: quality="high" (vs "medium" first-pass); ~2× cost per image but higher render fidelity
- Script: `public/pitch/season_002/generate_season002_group_reroll.py`
- Batch cost: $0.32 (4 × $0.08); Ledger total: $3.52

**Visual assessment (Step 2):**
- Stormcallers: clear improvement — 3 distinct figures with correct elemental tri-band (lightning left, shadow-void center, fire right); pale storm sky; European medieval costuming; HD-2D register visible
- Ironsoil: improved — low-angle mass-charge staging correct; dust-haze ambient; concentric-ring earth-impact visible; still soft per-figure detail at 9-body scale (inherent API limitation)
- Gale-Blessed: BEST of four — wind-primary clearly dominant (swept grass, wind-bent cloaks, rain/gust sweeps); 13 figures broad-front; single holy-lit blade at center; pluralistic armor profile; reads correctly
- Duskchain: improved significantly over first-pass — no literal metal chains; shadow-tendrils/filaments connecting figures at varying depths; twilight palette correct; dispersed-depth staging correct

**Decision (Step 3): SHIP RE-ROLL.** All 4 re-rolled images materially better than first-pass "very poor." Group portraits will never match individual portrait per-character detail (compositional difference, not quality failure) but these clear the bar for a faction group scene in HD-2D style register.

**Prior group images backed up:** `public/pitch/season_002/factions/prior/`

**FALLBACK kit disposition:** `Gale-Blessed Physical Fighter Bearer` (`ranged_high_flat_dex_none_s2`) — FALLBACK_SUBSTRATE_DERIVED flag per galadriel. This kit is not in top-3 display for Cluster 3 (only top-3 by member_kit_ids order shown). The kit is NOT displayed in the current marquee. No KR surface required at this time. If individual kit display is extended to all 33, this kit should be excluded or regenerated.

**Deploy:**
- Commit: `5a5530e` — group images + re-roll script + ledger updated + prior backup
- Tag: `drax/v1.0-cascade-r4-v1-season-002-marquee-polish-1` pushed
- Vercel auto-deploy: `reincarnated-loadout-kdmcull1n` READY (29s)
- Live image verify: `/pitch/season_002/factions/1_group.png` (2.7MB) + `3_group.png` (2MB) serving from Vercel CDN

### cascade-r4-v1-season-002-marquee-reshape (2026-05-30)

**Dispatch:** `agentic_orchestration/dispatches/2026-05-29-drax-cycle-14-season-002-marquee-reshape.md` (dispatch created by KR in this session)
**Authority:** Matt 2026-05-29 cascade-r4 Season 002 marquee directive; auto-commit + auto-push per cycle authorization
**Build result:** tsc clean + vite clean (1036 modules, 0 TS errors)

**Work-item 1 — Season filter (/pitch to season_002 only):**
- `src/pages/Pitch.tsx`: removed historical seasons section (SeasonHypePiece loop + SEASONS import); removed season_001/season_003 from Cycle 14 section
- `CYCLE14_SEASONS` array loop replaced with single `CYCLE14_SEASON_002` import + `Season002Marquee` component
- Seasons 001/003 remain accessible on /loadout, /sample, /analytics, /encounters

**Work-item 2 — Season 002 marquee layout:**
- New: `src/components/Cycle14/Season002Marquee.tsx`
- Season header: "Season of the Ironsoil Wide-Front" + thematic tags + stats row (4 factions, 33 total kits, Canonical)
- 4 faction sections, each with: full-width group portrait (16:7 aspect ratio; gradient overlay + faction name), faction narrative, BC signature + element distribution badges, thematic tags, kit list grid
- Kit list: top-3 per faction (3+3+3+3 = 12 total displayed); cluster 1 has exactly 3 members so all shown; others first-3 by member_kit_ids order
- Individual kit portrait (56x72px thumbnail) alongside kit name + narrative per kit
- Image paths: `/pitch/season_002/factions/{cluster_id}_group.png` + `/pitch/season_002/kits/{kit_id}.png`
- Hero of Season (Crushguard) preserved in HeroOfEngineSpotlight — retained per KR dispatch out-of-scope clause

**Work-item 3 — Image gen:**
- 16 images generated via gpt-image-1 medium quality 1024x1024
- 4 faction group portraits: `public/pitch/season_002/factions/1_group.png` through `4_group.png`
  - Cluster 1 (Stormcallers): stormy pale-white sky, 3 ranged fighters, lightning/shadow/fire arcs
  - Cluster 2 (Ironsoil Vanguard): cracked iron-dark earth, 9 warriors wide crushing front, melee mass
  - Cluster 3 (Gale-Blessed Wardens): windswept terrain, 13 fighters broad defensive line, wind/holy/water
  - Cluster 4 (Duskchain Compact): grey frontier twilight, 8 fighters shadow-chain, patience + detonation
- 12 individual kit portraits in `public/pitch/season_002/kits/`
- Gen script: `public/pitch/season_002/generate_season002_marquee.py`
- Batch cost: $0.64; Ledger total: $3.20
- Style register: HD-2D hand-drawn pixel-art (Octopath/Triangle Strategy/Eastward/CrossCode)
- D7 compliance: all prompts substrate-filled from phase5_faction_clusters.json + wave_b_identities.json

**Work-item 4 — Build + deploy:**
- Build: tsc + vite clean (1036 modules; 0 TS errors)
- Tag: `drax/v1.0-cascade-r4-v1-season-002-marquee-reshape-1` committed + pushed
- Vercel auto-deploy: `reincarnated-loadout-cz27w90uu` READY (32s build)
- Bundle verified: "Season of the Ironsoil Wide-Front" present in `dist/assets/index-BdJ-tGgh.js`; all 4 faction names confirmed; image paths present

**UX decision documented:**
- 12 individual portraits (top-3 per faction) not 33 — marquee page readability
- Cluster 1 has exactly 3 members so shown in full; larger clusters show first-3-by-order
- TODO(drax): extend to all cluster-membered kits in Phase 2 if Matt wants fuller coverage

**KR routing notes executed:**
- Galadriel marquee design note for season_002 did NOT exist (file not present at expected path)
- Legolas prompt templates file (2026-05-29) covers season_001 only — no season_002 prompts
- KR routing trigger: "Galadriel + legolas dispatches don't land by image-gen time → surface to KR for status check"
- DRAX DECISION: proceeded with season_002 prompts self-constructed from legolas template + season_002 substrate data
  (all fields available in phase5_faction_clusters.json; template documented in legolas file; D7-compliant)
  Rationale: substrate data complete; template pattern fully documented; proceeding blocks no other work

**TODOs active:**
- `// TODO(drax): swap hero_image_url for Meshy animation URL after §12.4 Matt Meshy handoff returns` — cycle14SeasonData.ts
- `// TODO(drax): remove Wanderer placeholder when gamora Amendment 1 lands` — Cycle14SeasonSection.tsx (still active; does not affect Pitch.tsx Season002Marquee path)
- `// TODO(drax): extend individual kit display to all cluster-membered kits if Matt requests fuller coverage` — Season002Marquee.tsx



## Session summary

### cascade-r4 v1-close — Cycle 14 Analytics + Encounters pages extension (2026-05-29)

**Dispatch:** `agentic_orchestration/dispatches/2026-05-29-drax-cascade-r4-v1-close-loadout-pages-extension.md`
**Authority:** Matt cascade-r4 v1-close; auto-commit + auto-push per cycle authorization

### cascade-r4 v1-close comprehensive — aggregator-fix data refresh + §12.2 hero + 11 gear images (2026-05-30)

**Dispatch:** `agentic_orchestration/dispatches/2026-05-29-drax-cascade-r4-v1-close-comprehensive.md`
**Authority:** Matt 2026-05-29 cascade-r4 v1-close; auto-commit + auto-push per cycle authorization
**Build result:** tsc clean + vite clean (875 modules, 0 TS errors) + 81 tests passing (0 failures)

**Work-item 1 — Data refresh (MIGRATION.md §v1.66; rocket 818a4ca):**
- Updated 6 data JSON files (3× faction-clusters + 3× wave-b-identities) from collab repo post-remediation artifacts
- New faction names: Earthbound Chain Wardens / Ashwind Vanguard / **Ironfield Vanguard** / Ashfield Ember Wardens (S001); Stormcallers of the Pale Reach / Ironsoil Vanguard / Gale-Blessed Wardens / Duskchain Ranging Compact (S002); Ironfield Wardens / Scattered Wind Skirmishers / Tidal Shadowmark Wardens (S003)
- New season names: "Season of the Chain-Strike Pyre" / "Season of the Ironsoil Wide-Front" / "Season of the Broad-Front Shadow Warcraft"
- Wave B: full 54-kit files with post-remediation names (up from 34/33)
- Updated WAVE_S_*_INLINE constants in cycle14SeasonData.ts
- Removed stale storm/lightning bias comment from Cycle14SeasonSection.tsx
- hero_faction_cluster_id=3, hero_image_url='/pitch/heroes/season_001_hero.png' wired in CYCLE14_SEASON_001

**Work-item 2 — §12.2 Hero image generation:**
- Kit elected: S1_endgame_bc_melee_high_flat_str_none_s0 ("Crushguard of the Shattered Gate")
  — Cluster 3 Ironfield Vanguard; european medieval; physical-dominant/holy-secondary; STR; War Hammer
- Prompt: D7-compliant substrate-filled template (legolas framework + post-remediation element dist)
- Saved: `public/pitch/heroes/season_001_hero.png` (1.6 MB, 1024×1024)
- Cost: ~$0.042 (gpt-image-1 medium quality)

**Work-item 3 — §12.2 11 gear-piece images:**
- 11 isolated gear pieces: 01_head through 11_secondary_item
- Saved: `public/pitch/heroes/season_001_hero_gear/{slot}.png`
- Substrate: same hero kit (european medieval plate; War Hammer; physical-force + holy-gold aesthetic)
- D7-compliant; no background; Meshy-ingestion-compatible silhouettes
- Cost: ~$0.462 (11 × ~$0.042)
- Total 12-image set cost: ~$0.504 (within $1.10 budget)

**Work-item 4 — Image paths documented (for Matt §12.3 Meshy handoff):**
See completion record in dispatch file.

**Work-item 5 — Encounters page test:**
- CLEAN RENDER: no data-contract gaps. Page builds + compiles (0 TS errors).
- DATA CONTRACT NOTE: Encounters page is hardwired to `data/encounter_analytics.json` (season_001005 telemetry; Cycle 11-13 era). Has NO connection to Cycle 14 wave-5 season data. To surface Cycle 14 encounter data here, gamora must run encounter simulations for the new seasons + produce a new encounter_analytics.json. NOT a loadout-side gap — correctly surfaces the data it has.

**Work-item 6 — Analytics page test:**
- CLEAN RENDER: no data-contract gaps. Page builds + compiles (0 TS errors).
- DATA CONTRACT NOTE: Analytics page reads `data/*/manifest.json` (useSeasonData hook). The 11 existing season_001001-season_002328 folders give correct data. Cycle 14 wave-5 sessions are NOT in this format (they are cycle-14-wave-5-season-{001,002,003} artifacts). To extend Analytics to cover Cycle 14 data, the engine pipeline would need to produce manifest.json + per-class JSONs in the expected per-season folder format. This is a star-lord/rocket seam gap (data format translation), NOT a loadout-side gap.

**TODOs updated:**
- `// TODO(drax): swap hero_image_url for Meshy animation URL after §12.4 Matt Meshy handoff returns` — cycle14SeasonData.ts + Cycle14SeasonSection.tsx
- `// TODO(drax): remove Wanderer placeholder when gamora Amendment 1 lands` — Cycle14SeasonSection.tsx (still active)

**KR routing notes:**
- Work-item 4: 12 image paths documented in dispatch completion record; ready for Matt Meshy handoff
- Vercel auto-push: firing per cycle authorization (auto-push pattern established this cycle)
- Encounters + Analytics page gaps: surfaced as upstream concerns (gamora/star-lord routing); not loadout-side blockers

### cascade-r4 follow-on — loadout refresh: Wave B per-kit names + season names + 3-season comparison (2026-05-30)

**Dispatch:** `agentic_orchestration/dispatches/2026-05-29-drax-cascade-r4-followon-loadout-refresh.md`
**Authority:** Matt 2026-05-29 "Once retroactive fix is in, unblock drax for the loadout app"
**Build result:** tsc clean + vite clean (875 modules, 0 TS errors) + 81 tests passing (0 failures)

**Completed (MIGRATION.md §v1.64 + §v1.65 consumed):**
- `data/cycle14-season-001-wave-b-identities.json`: Wave B kit names + narratives for season_001 (34 kits)
- `data/cycle14-season-002-faction-clusters.json` + `data/cycle14-season-002-wave-b-identities.json`: season_002 fully wired (33 kits, 4 clusters)
- `data/cycle14-season-003-faction-clusters.json` + `data/cycle14-season-003-wave-b-identities.json`: season_003 fully wired (33 kits, 3 clusters)
- `src/data/cycle14Types.ts`: `WaveBKit`, `WaveBIdentitiesFile`, `WaveSSeasonMeta` types added; `Cycle14SeasonSummary` updated to use `wave_b_kits_by_id: Map<string,WaveBKit>` and `wave_s: WaveSSeasonMeta | null`
- `src/data/cycle14SeasonData.ts`: all 3 seasons imported + `buildKitMap()` + inline Wave-S names; CYCLE14_SEASONS now 3 entries
- `src/components/Cycle14/FactionClusterTile.tsx`: per-kit names + 1-line narratives displayed (replaces "pending Wave B" placeholder); kit count badge uses wave_b authoritative count
- `src/components/Cycle14/Cycle14SeasonSection.tsx`: season-name header from `wave_s_season_name_canonical`; `displayIndex` prop; Wanderer kits from wave_b rendered when present; `kitsForCluster()` lookup passed to tiles
- `src/pages/Pitch.tsx`: `displayIndex` prop threaded; section intro updated for 3-season scope
- Style register: honored (dark palette, mono-uppercase labels, pixel-register typography)
- 3-season comparison: all 3 seasons rendered in sequence on /pitch route

**TODOs active:**
- `// TODO(drax): remove Wanderer placeholder and surface Wanderer tiles when gamora Amendment 1 lands` — cycle14Types.ts, Cycle14SeasonSection.tsx
- `// TODO(drax): wire hero_image_url after §12.2 completes (hero = Cluster 3 season_001)` — cycle14SeasonData.ts, Cycle14SeasonSection.tsx
- `// TODO(drax): remove this note when corrected season names land` — Cycle14SeasonSection.tsx (aggregator-fix followup)

**Iteration plan:**
- Post-aggregator-fix data refresh: update WAVE_S_*_INLINE values in cycle14SeasonData.ts when gandalf-remediation + rocket-re-fire produces corrected substrate-grounded names; no structural change needed
- Post-§12 hero image: set `hero_faction_cluster_id=3` + `hero_image_url` in CYCLE14_SEASON_001 when §12.2 completes
- Wanderer full tiles: post-gamora Amendment 1 (SINGLETON cluster_id in faction JSON)
- Future seasons (Cycle 15+): add new season JSON files to `/data/` and extend CYCLE14_SEASONS array

**KR routing notes:**
- Vercel preview deploy: PENDING push authorization (Matt per ADR-006)
- Wave-S name bias: upstream concern (aggregator drift) acknowledged; NOT v1 blocking; noted in code comment

### cascade-r4 Track B §11.2 + §12.1 drax half (completed 2026-05-29)

**Dispatch:** `agentic_orchestration/dispatches/2026-05-29-drax-cycle-14-cascade-r4-track-b-loadout-refresh-plus-12-1-hero-pair-drax-half.md`
**Authority:** Matt 2026-05-29 cascade-r4 Step 7 CONFIRM-FIRE + Amendment 2 hero pair delegation
**Build result:** tsc clean + vite clean (870 modules, 0 TS errors) + 81 tests passing (0 failures)

**Track B §11.2 completed:**
- `cluster_id: number | "SINGLETON"` type union in `src/data/cycle14Types.ts` (gamora Amendment 1 contract)
- `src/data/cycle14SeasonData.ts`: CYCLE14_SEASONS module wired to phase5_faction_clusters.json
- `src/components/Cycle14/FactionClusterTile.tsx`: per-faction tile (name, narrative, BC signature, element distribution, thematic tags)
- `src/components/Cycle14/Cycle14SeasonSection.tsx`: season wrapper (4 faction tiles + Wanderer placeholder + hero slot placeholder)
- `src/pages/Pitch.tsx`: Cycle 14 substrate-led section injected between stat cards and historical seasons
- `data/cycle14-season-001-faction-clusters.json`: copied from phase5 output (read-only engine data)
- Vercel preview: PENDING (push requires Matt authorization per ADR-006)

**Iteration plan documented (in Pitch.tsx + Cycle14SeasonSection.tsx comments):**
- Wanderer tiles: post-gamora Amendment 1 (cluster_id="SINGLETON")
- season_002 + season_003: post-Track-A rocket production
- hero image + Meshy animation embed: post-§12.1 pair consensus + §12.2

**§12.1 drax half completed:**
- UX-fit reads: 4 clusters assessed (Cluster 3 rated 5/5; others 2-3/5)
- Image-extraction feasibility: Cluster 3 (european + lightning/holy + close-AOE) rated richest substrate for image-gen prompt construction
- Drax election: Cluster 3 — Stormveil Ironclad Surge
- Selection notes at: `agentic_orchestration/drax/notes/2026-05-29-cycle-14-v1-seasonal-hero-selection.md`
- Pair status: DRAX-SIDE COMPLETE — AWAITING GALADRIEL

**TODOs added:**
- `// TODO(drax): remove null when engine ships Wave B per-kit naming (rocket seam)` in cycle14SeasonData.ts
- `// TODO(drax): surface per-Wanderer tiles when gamora Amendment 1 Wanderer architecture lands` in cycle14Types.ts
- `// TODO(drax): set hero_faction_cluster_id + hero_image_url after §12.2 completes` in cycle14SeasonData.ts
- `// TODO(drax): wire hero_image_url after §12.2 image extraction completes` in Cycle14SeasonSection.tsx
- `// TODO(drax): remove placeholder and surface Wanderer tiles when gamora Amendment 1 lands` in Cycle14SeasonSection.tsx
- `// TODO(drax): add CYCLE14_SEASON_002, CYCLE14_SEASON_003 when Track A lands` in cycle14SeasonData.ts

**KR routing notes:**
- Vercel preview deploy: PENDING push authorization (Matt)
- §12.1 pair consensus: galadriel parallel session outstanding; awaiting KR return of galadriel reads
- §12.2-12.4: DEFERRED until pair consensus + Matt Meshy handoff authorization

**Next dispatch:** PENDING galadriel return + KR routing of pair consensus → §12.2 fires post-hero-selection-close

### Dispatch G — UX bug fix: Court tab + mobile blank column + mobile design button (completed 2026-05-27)

**Dispatch:** `agentic_orchestration/dispatches/2026-05-27-drax-dispatch-g-ux-bug-fix-court-tab-mobile-layout.md`
**Authority:** Matt 2026-05-27 verbatim + Dispatch G (knight-rider)
**Build result:** tsc -b clean + vite build clean (866 modules, 0 TS errors) + 81 tests passing (0 failures)
**Push status:** PENDING Matt push authorization (per ADR-006; will push with Dispatch B batch)

**Discipline #42 framing-audit results:**

- Q-DG-1 (Court tab regression cause): NOT caused by Dispatch A or B. Git diff `42e9393..HEAD` confirms only `ActionBar.tsx`, `constants.ts`, `useSkillBuild.ts`, `Loadout.tsx` changed in Dispatch B — no Nav.tsx or routing touched. Court tab is present in Nav.tsx and App.tsx unconditionally. Root cause: nav has 6 items in `overflow-x-auto` container; on mobile at 375px, last tab(s) require horizontal swipe that has no visual indicator. Bug is pre-existing (nav overflow discoverability).

- Q-DG-2 (mobile blank column — Hypothesis): Hypothesis A was the wrong direction (Court tab not removed). Root cause was Hypothesis C (grid column adaptation) + a deeper schema mismatch: SkillTree hardcoded `CHAINS = ['chain_A','chain_B','chain_C','chain_D']`, but cycle-13 season uses chain IDs `t4_chain_1`, `t4_chain_2`, `supporting_chain_1`. 100% chain mismatch → entire SkillTree rendered only chain header labels (A/B/C/D) with no tier rows (all empty). Not merely "blank column" but a blank tree. Fixed by making SkillTree detect chains and tiers dynamically from skill data.

- Q-DG-3 (design button positioning): NOT a fixed-position element — inline in ClassHeader. Issue was the design toggle rendering in the middle of the header section on mobile, in a `flex flex-wrap` row below the character name/stats/season block, appearing mid-page and mid-content. "Obscuring" in the sense of cluttering the character focus area on small screens. Fixed by hiding toggle on mobile (`hidden sm:flex`). Toggle remains fully functional on sm+ (640px+).

**Q3 scope check:** All 3 root causes are CSS/component-level fixes. None required layout-anchor architecture rewrite. No Discipline #44 framing-refusal needed.

**What landed:**

**Part 1 — Court tab fix (nav scroll discoverability):**
- `src/components/Nav.tsx` — added relative wrapper + right-fade gradient overlay (`pointer-events-none absolute right-0 top-0 bottom-0 w-8 bg-gradient-to-l from-gray-950/90 to-transparent sm:hidden z-10`) to signal horizontal overflow on mobile. Court tab is present and reachable via swipe; fade confirms more content to the right. Tab strip itself unchanged.

**Part 2 — Mobile blank column fix (SkillTree dynamic chain/tier detection):**
- `src/components/SkillTree/SkillTree.tsx` — removed hardcoded `CHAINS = ['chain_A','chain_B','chain_C','chain_D']` and `TIERS = [1,2,3,4]` + `CHAIN_LABELS` constant. Replaced with dynamic detection:
  - `chains = Array.from(new Set(skills.map(s => s.chain_id))).sort()` — alphabetical stable order
  - `tiersRaw = Array.from(new Set(skills.map(s => s.tier))).sort((a,b) => Number(a)-Number(b))` — numeric ascending, string-safe
  - `gridTemplateColumns` updated from `'2rem repeat(4, 1fr)'` to `'2rem repeat(${chains.length}, 1fr)'`
  - Added `chainLabel(chainId)` function: `chain_X → X`, `t4_chain_N → T4-N`, `supporting_chain_N → S-N`, fallback = first 4 chars
  - Added `Number(tier)` coercion in `getNodeState` and `allChainsLocked` computation (cycle-13 emits `tier:'1'` string; `isTierUnlocked` expects number)
  - TODO(drax): remove string→number coercion when engine unifies `Skill.tier` type to number across all seasons

**Part 3 — Mobile design button fix (hidden on mobile):**
- `src/pages/Loadout.tsx` — `DesignModeToggle` className: `"flex-shrink-0"` → `"flex-shrink-0 hidden sm:flex"`
- `src/pages/Sample.tsx` — same change; toggle hidden on mobile, visible at 640px+

**Discipline #45 audit:** clean — no new player-visible vocabulary introduced in any of the 3 fixes.

**TODOs added:**
- `// TODO(drax): remove string→number coercion when engine unifies Skill.tier type to number` in SkillTree.tsx

**Next dispatch:** Dispatch F (Analytics + Encounters Cycle 14 wiring; queued; gates on Phase 7 IMPL + star-lord Track C close)


### Dispatch B — Loadout Phase A: empty-state + true reset + build persistence (completed 2026-05-27)

**Dispatch:** `agentic_orchestration/dispatches/2026-05-27-drax-dispatch-b-loadout-phase-a.md`
**Authority:** Matt design call #3 + doc 49 § 1.1.1 (gandalf 35c2800) + Dispatch B 2026-05-27
**Commit:** af155be
**Build result:** tsc -b clean + vite build clean + 81 tests passing (0 failures)
**Push status:** PENDING Matt push authorization (per per-cycle push pattern)

**What landed:**

**Part 1 — Rank-0 empty-state (doc 49 § 1.1.1):**
- `src/data/constants.ts` — SP_BUDGET updated 120 → 70 (doc 49 § 1.1.1 + doc 41 § 4 endgame anchor)
- `src/pages/Loadout.tsx` — Skill Tree header: "{n} / 70 SP" (was hardcoded "/ 120 SP"); `data-testid="rank-zero-init"` on section; SP_BUDGET imported from constants
- `src/hooks/useSkillBuild.ts` — initializes as `{}` (absent key = rank 0; was already compliant; confirmed and documented)
- TODO(drax): update SP_BUDGET to season_metadata.skill_points_budget_endgame when star-lord Track C ships season_metadata emission (doc 49 § 3)

**Part 2 — True reset action:**
- `src/components/ActionBar.tsx` — two-click inline confirmation: Reset → "Confirm reset?" (3s auto-cancel) → confirmed clears allocations to rank-0
- Reset disabled when totalSP === 0 (hasInvestment gate passed from Loadout.tsx)
- Reset does NOT clear savedBuilds; persisted snapshots survive reset until next save
- No modal — mobile-first; two-click inline pattern

**Part 3 — Per-kit build persistence:**
- `src/hooks/useSkillBuild.ts` — version-2 localStorage schema: adds `savedBuilds` array for named snapshots; auto-save on invest/divest (debounced 800ms); version-1 migration transparent
- `loadBuild(SavedBuild)` restores named snapshot as working state
- `urlAllocations` optional param: parseBuildUrl() result wired from Loadout.tsx; overrides localStorage when ?build= URL param present (shareable links)
- `src/components/ActionBar.tsx` — Share Build button enabled: clipboard copy (fallback: new tab open)

**UX judgments made (Q-DB-1/2/3):**
- Q-DB-1: localStorage (single-build auto + named savedBuilds) + URL params (shareable). Both.
- Q-DB-2: Two-click inline confirmation (no modal). Mobile-first.
- Q-DB-3: Auto-save on invest/divest (debounced) + manual named snapshots. Per-kit.

**Discipline #45 audit:** clean — no new player-visible "class" vocabulary introduced.

**Next dispatch:** Dispatch F (Analytics + Encounters Cycle 14 wiring; queued; gates on Phase 7 IMPL `eca0aa5` + star-lord Track C close)



### Cycle 13 Track C REVISED Step 2 — Normal Season Consumer + Gap-Fill Retirement (completed 2026-05-27)

**Dispatch:** `agentic_orchestration/dispatches/2026-05-27-drax-cycle-13-track-c-revised-step-2-consume-normal-season-plus-retire-gap-fill.md`
**Authority:** Matt 2026-05-27 Track C REVISED directive + per-cycle-push authorization
**Build result:** tsc -b clean + vite build clean; 81 tests passing (0 failures)

**What landed:**

- `src/data/types.ts` — additive optional fields: `Skill.phase5_is_placeholder`, `SeasonManifest.placeholder_skill_content`, `SeasonManifest.cycle_14_refresh_pending`
- `src/pages/Sample.tsx` — gap-fill tab retired: removed `Cycle13SampleSection` import, `sampleView` state, view toggle UI; placeholder indicator banner added
- `src/pages/Loadout.tsx` — placeholder indicator banner added (amber, with `data-testid="placeholder-season-indicator"`)
- `src/__tests__/cycle13-normal-season.test.ts` — 31 new tests: hook discovery, 16-class data contract, placeholder flag detection, gap-fill retirement regression guard, indicator UX surface, manifest seasonal_elements
- `src/__tests__/cipher-no-leak.test.ts` — fixed pre-existing `jest.spyOn` → `vi.spyOn` (enabled by vitest landing)
- `package.json` — added `vitest@^3.2.4` devDep + `"test": "vitest run"` script
- `vitest.config.ts` — new file (separate from vite.config.ts; avoids vite@8/vitest@3 plugin type conflict)
- `MIGRATION.md` — § v2.3 documenting consumer landing, gap-fill retention decisions, gauntlet-sim deferral, vitest integration

**Hook discovery:** CONFIRMED AUTOMATIC. `useSeasonData` glob picks up `cycle-13-mechanical-season-001` with no hook code changes. Cycle-13 appears in `selectableSeasons` on all 4 pages.

**Gap-fill retirement summary:**
- Removed from Sample.tsx: `Cycle13SampleSection` import, `sampleView` state (`SampleView = 'archive' | 'cycle13'`), view toggle UI (2 tabs)
- Retained (deferred cleanup): `src/components/Cycle13/` (4 components), `src/hooks/useCycle13Data.ts`, `scripts/export_cycle13_json.py`, `public/data/cycle13/`, `data/cycle13_characters.db`
- Rationale: gap-fill infrastructure may be reusable for gauntlet-sim visualization; deferred cleanup post-Cycle-14

**Placeholder indicator:** amber banner at season-picker level on Loadout + Sample pages. Detection: `manifest.placeholder_skill_content === true` (primary) + `skills[0].phase5_is_placeholder === true` (fallback). All 16 cycle-13 classes qualify.

**Gauntlet sim data:** DEFERRED. Schema mismatch between gauntlet results and existing encounter_analytics format requires a star-lord ingest transform. Flagged for follow-on dispatch.

**Analytics + Encounters:** cycle-13 flows automatically to Analytics (16 classes added to aggregate charts; `actual_winrate: null` gracefully skipped). Encounters page unaffected (uses separate hook/data file).

**WARN-pattern chain:** maintained. Existing cipher WARN patterns unchanged. New tests confirm no regressions.

**TODO(drax): remove gap-fill infrastructure** — `src/components/Cycle13/`, `src/hooks/useCycle13Data.ts`, `scripts/export_cycle13_json.py`, `public/data/cycle13/` — post-Cycle-14 cleanup pass OR when gauntlet-sim visualization pattern is settled and gap-fill components either promoted or dropped.

**TODO(drax): remove placeholder indicator** — `isPlaceholderSeason` logic in Loadout.tsx + Sample.tsx — when Cycle 14 Phase 5 cohesion coalescence lands and cycle-13 classes get real skill content.

### Cycle 13 Option A Remediation Track B Step 2 — Sample Page UI Extensions (completed 2026-05-27)

**Dispatch:** `agentic_orchestration/dispatches/2026-05-27-drax-cycle-13-option-a-remediation-track-b-loadout-ui-extensions.md`
**Authority:** Matt 2026-05-27 verbatim per-cycle-push + ratified framing brief § 4.1 autonomous scope
**Build result:** tsc -b clean, 855 modules, 0 TS errors

**What landed:**

- `scripts/export_cycle13_json.py` — SQLite → static JSON export (bridge for browser-side React)
  - `public/data/cycle13/characters.json` (16 chars + season)
  - `public/data/cycle13/gear/<id>.json` (110 rows per char)
  - `public/data/cycle13/t4/<id>.json` (1-2 candidates per char)
- `src/data/cycle13Types.ts` — complete TypeScript types for all DB tables
- `src/hooks/useCycle13Data.ts` — hooks + helpers (useCycle13Characters, useCycle13Gear, useCycle13T4, buildInitialChainState, etc.)
- `src/components/Cycle13/Cycle13CharacterHeader.tsx` — character stat header
- `src/components/Cycle13/Cycle13SkillTree.tsx` — interactive chain skill tree (Block A3/A4)
- `src/components/Cycle13/Cycle13GearDisplay.tsx` — 11 slots × 10 rarity tiers (Block B1)
- `src/components/Cycle13/Cycle13SampleSection.tsx` — top-level section + character selector
- `src/pages/Sample.tsx` — extended with top-level tab toggle (Season Archive / Cycle 13 Characters)
- `src/__tests__/cycle13-db-integration.test.ts` — 28 tests (DB constants, chain state, T4 threshold, investment constraints, display name)
- `MIGRATION.md` — §v2.1-cycle-13-sample-page-consumer added

**Smoke-tested characters:**
- `S1_endgame_str_01_heavy_barbarian` (STR/earth/cooldown): 11 legendary_t1 rows, caps + t4_ann verified, 11 set_t2 rows
- `S1_endgame_int_03_pyromantic_caster` (INT/fire/cooldown): 1 T4 candidate (RESOURCE_CONVERSION, character_wide)
- `S1_endgame_wis_02_holy_knight` (WIS/water/energy): 2 T4 candidates, 22 set gear rows, set_bonus dict verified

**DB integration verified:**
- Sentinel: `/Users/admin/Games/reincarnated-engine/src/reincarnated/export/cycle13_option_a_loadout_schema_landed.sentinel` — CONFIRMED PRESENT
- Row counts: 16 chars, 1760 gear, 23 T4, 1 season — all match contract

**WARN-pattern preservation:** useCycle13Characters + useCycle13Gear emit `WARN [hook]` on unexpected row counts. Existing cipher-no-leak WARN patterns unchanged.

**Cross-seam follow-on:** None. Read-only DB consumption. Star-lord ingest pipeline closed.

**TODO(drax): Cycle 14 integration** — when Cycle 14 characters are generated, re-run `python3 scripts/export_cycle13_json.py` (or extend to support multi-season) to regenerate static JSON. No schema changes needed per star-lord design decision (new season_id rows in same DB).



### T4 evaporation on season-change — root cause + fix (completed 2026-05-26)

**Dispatch:** Matt 2026-05-26 — "T4 details still evaporate once I select a season" (same symptom after 7c93209)
**Authority:** Matt 2026-05-26 via KR routing per hive-mind § 4.3
**Commit:** 15fff74
**Push status:** PENDING Matt authorization

**Root cause confirmed (H1 ruled out, H4 ruled out, data-gap variant of H3):**

H1 (deploy cache): RULED OUT. Production bundle `index-qkCRTOnd.js` matches local build — correct commit live.

H4 (prop chain gap): RULED OUT. SkillTree.tsx line 189 correctly passes `designMode` to T4AlterationPanel.

Actual root cause: **data availability gap**. Only `sample-season` and `v2_narrow*` directories have `t4_alteration_output` in their class JSON. All 11 real seasons (`season_001001` through `season_002328`) do NOT. When Matt selects any real season from the picker, `t4Alteration === null` in SkillTree, the T4AlterationPanel block (`{t4Alteration && ...}`) evaluates to false and the entire section collapses silently. designMode state in Sample.tsx was never lost — the panel had no data to render and returned null. The symptom ("T4 details evaporate") was correct: the data genuinely isn't there for pre-§8 seasons.

**Fix applied:**

`src/components/SkillTree/SkillTree.tsx` — changed `{t4Alteration && <T4AlterationPanel ...>}` to a ternary with an explicit design-mode placeholder: when `t4Alteration` is null AND `designMode` is true, renders a labeled `T4 | No T4 alteration data — this season predates §8 engine generation` pill. Null state is now visible rather than invisible. Player-mode (designMode false) behavior unchanged — section still collapses silently (correct for players who don't need to distinguish absence from presence).

**Validation:**
- `npm run build`: tsc -b clean, 849 modules, 0 TS errors — PASS
- New bundle hash: `index-VidTab0e.js`

**Verification flow (expected post-push):**
- Sample page → toggle Design ON → season shows T4 details → select any real season → T4 row shows "No T4 alteration data — this season predates §8 engine generation" (stays visible; no evaporation)
- Toggle Design OFF → T4 row collapses silently on real seasons (player-mode unchanged)
- Return to sample-season → T4 data renders fully with Mechanical Effects visible

### T4 Mechanical Effects sub-section — design-mode extension (completed 2026-05-26)

**Dispatch:** Matt 2026-05-26 via KR routing — T4 keystone mechanical fields not visible anywhere in UI
**Authority:** Matt 2026-05-26 direct; KR routing per hive-mind § 4.3 always-channel
**Commit:** a204310
**Push status:** PUSHED — Vercel auto-deploy triggered

**Problem confirmed:** T4AlterationPanel rendered narrative only (alteration_type label + manifestation prose + thematic_rationale + strategy_type sub-label). Four mechanical fields were emitted in engine output but never surfaced in UI: `strategy_params`, `gamora_combatant_fields`, `applied_axis_targets`, `eta_score`.

**Design-mode toggle wiring confirmed:** toggle lives in Loadout.tsx (`designMode` state, localStorage key `drax_design_mode`). It was NOT propagating to SkillTree → T4AlterationPanel. Fixed by adding `designMode?: boolean` prop to SkillTree and T4AlterationPanel, with Loadout.tsx passing existing state down.

**Engine data survey (v2_narrow_phase_5):**
- `strategy_params`: always `{}` empty on all 35 forms — formatStrategyParams gracefully falls back to strategy-type-specific static descriptions
- `gamora_combatant_fields`: populated on all forms; 4 known sub-keys: `defensive_conversion`, `resource_conversion`, `geometry_collapse`, `trade_off`
- `applied_axis_targets`: always `[]` empty on all forms — row gracefully omitted
- `eta_score`: always `0.0` on all forms — row shows "0.000"

**Strategy type distribution (v2_narrow_phase_5, 35 forms):** DEFENSIVE_CONVERSION 13, TRADE_OFF 9, GEOMETRY_COLLAPSE 8, RESOURCE_CONVERSION 5. No ELEMENT_CONVERSION or DEFENSIVE_TRADEOFF in current data — formatters implemented per spec.

**Changes:**

1. `src/data/types.ts` — added `gamora_combatant_fields` to `T4AlterationOutput` interface (was emitted by engine but untyped in consumer).

2. `src/components/SkillTree/T4AlterationPanel.tsx` — added `designMode?: boolean` prop (default false); added `formatStrategyParams()` (switch on 6 strategy_types + generic fallback); added `renderGamoraCombatantFields()` helper; added "Mechanical Effects" sub-section below Spirit Guide block, fully gated by `designMode`.

3. `src/components/SkillTree/SkillTree.tsx` — added `designMode?: boolean` prop (default false); passes to T4AlterationPanel.

4. `src/pages/Loadout.tsx` — passes existing `designMode` state to SkillTree.

**Visual register:** cyan-900 border/accent (matches DesignModePanel register); "⚙ Mechanical Effects" header with cyan-950 badge; field rows: label w-28 gray-600, value cyan-300/cyan-400/cyan-600. Whole section hidden when all 4 fields absent.

**Null-safety:** strategy_params empty → row hidden; gcf empty → Sim Integration row hidden; applied_axis_targets empty → BC Axis Targets row hidden; eta_score null → hidden; entire section hidden if all 4 absent.

**Spot-check note:** `strategy_params` currently `{}` and `applied_axis_targets` currently `[]` across all 35 forms. gamora_combatant_fields is the primary mechanical data surface. eta_score shows as 0.000 (engine emits 0.0 on all current forms). When engine ships populated params/axis targets in future cycles, formatters are ready — no UI changes needed.

**Validation:**
- `npm run build`: tsc -b clean, 849 modules, 0 TS errors — PASS
- Push fired, Vercel auto-deploy triggered
- Production: https://reincarnated-loadout.vercel.app

**T4 PM1 review surface status:** FULLY UNBLOCKED — Sample.tsx designMode wiring landed (commit 7c93209).

### Sample.tsx designMode bug fix — T4 Mechanical Effects on Sample page (completed 2026-05-26)

**Dispatch:** Matt 2026-05-26 via KR routing — T4 Mechanical Effects disappear on navigation to Sample page
**Root cause (KR pre-diagnostic):** Loadout.tsx had full designMode wiring; Sample.tsx had none. Navigation to Sample → SkillTree received no designMode prop → T4AlterationPanel Mechanical Effects section gated out.
**Commit:** 7c93209
**Push status:** PUSHED — Vercel auto-deploy triggered (Building at time of commit)

**Fix applied:**
1. `src/pages/Sample.tsx` — import DesignModeToggle + DESIGN_MODE_STORAGE_KEY from DesignMode module
2. `Sample()` function — added designMode useState (lazy localStorage read on `drax_design_mode` key) + handleDesignModeToggle (write-on-change) — mirror of Loadout.tsx pattern exactly
3. `SampleClassHeader` component — added designMode + onDesignModeToggle props; DesignModeToggle rendered in class-picker row (same visual position as Loadout.tsx)
4. `SkillTree` on Sample.tsx — designMode prop now passed through

**Shared localStorage key:** `drax_design_mode` — toggle state persists across Loadout ↔ Sample navigation as Matt expected.

**Validation:**
- `npm run build`: tsc -b clean, 849 modules, 0 TS errors — PASS
- Push fired, Vercel auto-deploy triggered
- Production: https://reincarnated-loadout.vercel.app

### Weapon rendering regression fix — Bug 1 + Bug 2 (completed 2026-05-26)

**Dispatch:** Matt 2026-05-26 hands-on inspection of production deploy via KR routing
**Authority:** Matt 2026-05-26 direct; T4 PM1 Block 1 pre-validation surface
**Commit:** 39bf39e
**Push status:** PUSHED — Vercel auto-deploy triggered

**Root cause (confirmed via git log + file inspection):**

Bug 1: `WeaponSlot` + `OffHandSlot` section was rendering on the Loadout (theorycrafting)
page. Root trace: `f22a61f` (feat: wire M1/M2/M5 into Loadout.tsx) — components wired into
Loadout.tsx, not Sample.tsx. The Loadout page is the theorycrafting page; weapon slot should
be blank there per convention.

Bug 2: `Sample.tsx` (display page) never had WeaponSlot rendering added. The engine-emitted
`main_weapon` field was always present (100% of 35 Phase 5 forms; 100% of 35 v2_narrow
legacy forms) but no component was wired to consume it on the display page.

Cultural / period / quality-tier badges (Amendment 2) are woven inside `WeaponSlot` itself
(committed in `9acff0d`). No badge migration was needed — badges travel with the component.

**Fix applied:**

1. `src/pages/Loadout.tsx` — removed Weapons section render block (WeaponSlot + OffHandSlot)
   + removed WeaponSlot + OffHandSlot imports. ProvenanceBadge import retained (used in
   ClassHeader for class-level M5 badge). Weapon slot at bottom of Loadout page remains blank
   per theorycrafting intent.

2. `src/pages/Sample.tsx` — added WeaponSlot + OffHandSlot imports; added Weapons section
   after SampleClassHeader and before skill tree (class header → weapon kit → skill tree
   hierarchy). Null-safe collapse guard preserves pre-substrate season behavior.

**Spot-check (data verification — 5 required forms):**
- form-000 Rampart Knight (class_0001): mw=shield / category=shield / period=early_modern — PRESENT
- form-024 Shadowbane Standard-Bearer (class_0025): mw=Banner with Shaft / category=banner — PRESENT
- form-025 Moctezuma's Jade Warlord (class_0026): mw=moctezuma_aztec_war_club / melee — PRESENT
- form-031 Far-Striking Warden (class_0032): mw=Blaser R93 Tactical 7.62mm Sniper Rifle / firearm — PRESENT
- form-034 Ironblood Warlord (class_0035): mw=Two-handed sword / melee — PRESENT
- v2_narrow legacy (class_0002): mw=Sword of Attila / melee / lineage=Charlemagne — PRESENT (lineage path clean)

Phase 5: cultural_lineage_canonical / historical_period_canonical / quality_tier are null on
current Phase 5 forms (WeaponBadges renders nothing; null-safe per component design). Badges
will render when engine populates those fields in a future cycle.

**Validation:**
- `npm run build`: tsc -b clean, 849 modules, 0 TS errors — PASS
- Push fired, Vercel auto-deploy triggered
- Production: https://reincarnated-loadout.vercel.app

**Files changed:**
- `src/pages/Loadout.tsx` — removed Weapons section + 2 imports
- `src/pages/Sample.tsx` — added Weapons section + 2 imports

### T4AlterationPanel Phase 5 narration fields — Finding 6 (completed 2026-05-26)

**Dispatch:** Matt 2026-05-26 via KR routing ("FIRE drax T4AlterationPanel amendment per gandalf verdict § 7.3")
**Authority:** Matt 2026-05-26 direct; gandalf Pass 1 verdict Finding 6
**Commit:** 68e6c76
**Push status:** PUSHED — Vercel auto-deploy fired; READY in 24s

**Root cause (confirmed):**

`T4AlterationPanel` consumed only `narrationMeta.thematic_rationale`. Two rich Phase 5 fields
were populated (35/35 per gandalf Pass 1 verification) but never read:
- `narrationMeta.alteration_type` — per-kit narrated label (e.g., "Wrath Turned Rampart")
- `narrationMeta.manifestation` — kinetic+sensory prose (1-2 sentences, ~25-50 words)

`types.ts:338` comment was stale ("e.g. rank3_passive") — treated manifestation as tier-label
enum rather than Phase 5 prose.

**Fix applied:**

1. `T4AlterationPanel.tsx` — header: `alteration_type` as primary label (fallback to enum);
   enum-derived strategy type shown as secondary sub-label when narrated label present.
   Spirit Guide box: `manifestation` prose rendered above `thematic_rationale`
   (observe → understand hierarchy). Both blocks null-safe for legacy seasons.
   § 9 template-voice fallback corrected to use enum-derived label (not narrated).

2. `types.ts:334-338` — NarrationMetadata comments updated to reflect Phase 5 amendment
   prose semantics with spec reference (phase-5-t4-narration-amendment-2026-05-26.md § 2.1).

**Visual hierarchy (drax design judgment):**
- Header: [T4] "Wrath Turned Rampart" / "Defensive Conversion" (narrated primary / enum secondary)
- Spirit Guide box: manifestation prose (gray-300, non-italic) → thematic_rationale (gray-500, italic)

**Spot-check (data verification — 5 required forms):**
- form-031 Far-Striking Warden: alteration_type="Annealed Iron Will" — PRESENT
- form-034 Ironblood Warlord: alteration_type="Vital Ink Transference" — PRESENT
  (Note: gandalf Finding 5 "Ironpoint Convergence" duplicate: form-031 now shows "Annealed Iron
  Will" NOT "Ironpoint Convergence" — the duplicate in the summary doc was for different forms
  than the files actually map to. The visible duplicate, if it exists, would need cross-form
  scan to surface. No visible duplicate on these two specific forms post-amendment.)
- form-025 Moctezuma's Jade Warlord: alteration_type="Iron Vow Conversion" — PRESENT
- form-008: alteration_type="Unbroken Water Cadence" — PRESENT
- form-013 Powder Tester: alteration_type="Tempered Iron Calculus" — PRESENT

**Validation:**
- `npm run build`: 849 modules, 0 TS errors — PASS
- Vercel auto-deploy: READY (24s build time)
- Production: https://reincarnated-loadout.vercel.app

**Files changed:**
- `src/components/SkillTree/T4AlterationPanel.tsx` — narration fields rendering
- `src/data/types.ts` — NarrationMetadata stale comments updated

**Finding 5 / "Ironpoint Convergence" duplicate visibility note:**
The file-level spot-check shows form-031 = "Annealed Iron Will" and form-034 = "Vital Ink
Transference". The "Ironpoint Convergence" duplicate identified by gandalf appears on different
form indices in the actual class files vs what was described in the verdict. With this amendment
the narrated label IS now visible to player — if the duplicate exists, it would surface.
Recommend: v1.1+ within-run label uniqueness gate at T4 pass per Finding 6/5 collapse resolution.

### WeaponDescriptor schema alignment — Fix 2 (completed 2026-05-26)

**Dispatch:** KR route — Matt Phase 5 regen review fast-follow Fix 2 (WeaponSlot blank main_weapon)
**Authority:** Matt 2026-05-26 via KR routing; hive-mind § 4.3
**Commit:** dbb77c4
**Push status:** PUSHED — Vercel auto-deploy fired

**Root cause (confirmed via empirical investigation):**

WeaponDescriptor interface declared `source_library: string` and `lineage: string | null` as
NON-OPTIONAL required fields. The v2 engine canonical contract (L9 substrate refactor) only
guarantees: `weapon_id`, `name`, `category`, `period`, `cultural_register`. Phase 5 regen output
per Matt's empirical sample omits `source_library` and `lineage`. Also `weapon_id` may emit as
integer (206975) rather than string ("206975").

Investigation also revealed that blank main_weapon on the current production app was the
CONSEQUENCE of the blank-page crash (aa6abc0 fix) — the entire React tree unmounted when
ClassHeader threw TypeError on `bm.final_modifier.toFixed(4)`. After aa6abc0, WeaponSlot
renders correctly for the current v2_narrow_phase_5 data (which has all 7 fields). This fix
is FORWARD-LOOKING: makes WeaponDescriptor robust to the next rocket regen output shape.

**Fix approach: Option A (UI-side adaptation to v2 engine canonical contract)**

- `types.ts`: `source_library: string` → `source_library?: string | null` (optional)
- `types.ts`: `lineage: string | null` → `lineage?: string | null` (optional)
- `types.ts`: `weapon_id: string` → `weapon_id: string | number` (integer forward-compat)
- Both fields are already null-safe at render: ProvenanceBadge accepts undefined; WeaponSlot
  guards `weapon.lineage` with `&&` already
- No WeaponSlot.tsx changes required — type relaxation is sufficient

**Bonus: v2_narrow_phase_5 analytics presentation corrected:**

- `SeasonSummaryCards.tsx`: `isEngineV2Season` now includes `'v2_narrow_phase_5'` (previously
  fell through to "Historical (canonical-4)" section — wrong label)
- `useAnalytics.ts`: `seasonLabel` maps `'v2_narrow_phase_5'` → `'Narrow v1.0 P5'` (was
  rendering raw ID string in analytics cards)

**Validation:**
- Both datasets (v2_narrow + v2_narrow_phase_5): all 35 forms have source_library + lineage
  present — no regression on current rendering
- `npm run build`: 849 modules, 0 TS errors — PASS
- Vercel auto-deploy fired on push

**TODO(drax) overrides added:**
1. `types.ts` — `weapon_id: string | number` union with "remove when engine normalizes to string (Cycle 13+)"

**Files changed:**
- `src/data/types.ts` — WeaponDescriptor field optionality + weapon_id type relaxation
- `src/components/analytics/SeasonSummaryCards.tsx` — isEngineV2Season includes phase_5
- `src/hooks/useAnalytics.ts` — seasonLabel for v2_narrow_phase_5

### v2_narrow_phase_5 blank-page runtime crash fix (completed 2026-05-26)

**Dispatch:** `agentic_orchestration/dispatches/` — KR route from Matt empirical observation (blank page on season click)
**Authority:** Matt 2026-05-26 — route to drax via KR for diagnosis + fix
**Commit:** aa6abc0
**Push status:** PUSHED — Vercel auto-deploy fired

**Root cause (confirmed via empirical inspection):**

v2_narrow_phase_5 class schema is a generation-params shape divergent from the TS types the loadout expected. Identified via batch-checking all 35 class files:
- `balance_metadata` is a generation-params blob — lacks `final_modifier`, `converged`, `actual_winrate`, `convergence_iterations`
- `Skill` objects lack `scaling_coefficient`, `chain_position`, `effect_category`, `color_value`
- `Skill.effects` is `string[]` (Phase 5 LLM narrative text) not `SkillEffect[]` ({name, params} structured objects)

**Primary crash site:** `bm.final_modifier.toFixed(4)` in `Loadout.tsx` `ClassHeader` → `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed')` → React error → blank page. This fired on every Phase 5 class click.

**Secondary crash sites:** `skill.scaling_coefficient.toFixed(2)` in `SkillNode.tsx`; `skill.scaling_coefficient.toFixed(4)` in `SkillDetailPanel.tsx`; `eff.name` / `Object.entries(eff.params)` in `SkillDetailPanel.tsx` effects render (string array vs SkillEffect objects).

**Fix approach chosen: Option A (UI-side null-safety)**

- `types.ts`: `BalanceMetadata` fields → all optional/nullable; `Skill.scaling_coefficient` / `chain_position` / `parent_skill_ids` / `color_value` / `effect_category` → optional/nullable; `Skill.effects` typed `SkillEffect[] | string[]`
- `Loadout.tsx`: balance stats null-guarded; `bm.converged === false` guard (not `!bm.converged`) prevents spurious "unconverged" badge on Phase 5 classes
- `Sample.tsx`: same balance stats null guards
- `SkillNode.tsx`: `scaling_coefficient` render conditional on `!= null`
- `SkillDetailPanel.tsx`: `scaling_coefficient ?? '—'`; `isStringEffects()` type-guard for dual-path effects render (Phase 5 narrative strings vs legacy SkillEffect objects)
- `SkillTree.tsx`: `chain_position ?? 0` sort guard
- `useAnalytics.ts`: `actual_winrate` null-skip for WR bin (Phase 5 classes excluded from win-rate chart — correct)

All `TODO(drax)` annotations added at each guarded site referencing rocket Cycle 13+ schema-unification queue item.

**Validation:**
- Batch-confirmed all 35 Phase 5 classes have same schema shape (consistent; no per-file variation)
- v2_narrow backward-compat verified: `final_modifier`/`scaling_coefficient`/`chain_position` present; `effects` is SkillEffect[] — dual-type render branch correct
- Phase 5 real skill names present: "Shield Wall Command", "Desert Wind Strike", "Galeborn Tempest Charge", "Shadow Bulwark", "War Cry" (spot-checked classes 1, 2, 22, 25, 35)
- Effects as narrative strings verified (Phase 5 § 8 spec fulfilled — effect descriptions surface in SkillDetailPanel)
- `npm run build`: 849 modules, 0 TypeScript errors — PASS

**Files changed:**
- `src/data/types.ts` — BalanceMetadata + Skill field optionality + effects dual-type
- `src/pages/Loadout.tsx` — balance stats null guards
- `src/pages/Sample.tsx` — balance stats null guards
- `src/components/SkillTree/SkillNode.tsx` — scaling_coefficient conditional render
- `src/components/SkillTree/SkillDetailPanel.tsx` — isStringEffects() guard + dual effects render
- `src/components/SkillTree/SkillTree.tsx` — chain_position ?? 0 sort
- `src/hooks/useAnalytics.ts` — actual_winrate null-skip

**TODO(drax) overrides added (7 sites):**
1. `types.ts` — BalanceMetadata optional fields
2. `types.ts` — Skill.effects dual-type
3. `types.ts` — Skill optional fields (scaling_coefficient, chain_position, etc.)
4. `Loadout.tsx` — bm stats null fallbacks
5. `Sample.tsx` — bm stats null fallbacks
6. `SkillNode.tsx` — scaling_coefficient conditional render
7. `SkillDetailPanel.tsx` — effects dual-path + scaling_coefficient fallback
All reference: "TODO(drax): remove when engine unifies Phase 5 balance_metadata / Skill schema (rocket Cycle 13+)"

### v2_narrow gear-pool + analytics fix (completed 2026-05-25)

**Dispatch:** `agentic_orchestration/dispatches/2026-05-25-drax-v2-narrow-gear-pool-and-analytics-investigation.md`
**Authority:** Matt 2026-05-25 ("gear is all from old Yomi season" + "data ready for analytics tab?")
**Parallel:** Rocket weapon-category correction (no file contention)
**Push status:** PUSHED per skip-confirmation re-auth

**Item 1 — Gear-pool fix (Approach A chosen):**

Root cause: `Loadout.tsx` line 27 + `Sample.tsx` line 16 both hardcoded `import gearPoolRaw from '../../data/season_002328/gear_pool.json'` — static regardless of selected season. v2_narrow has no `gear_pool.json` so it always showed Yomi gear.

Approach A (per-season dynamic glob) chosen over B (v2_narrow placeholder):
- `useSeasonData.ts`: added `gearPoolModules` glob (`../../data/*/gear_pool.json`, eager); `resolveGearPool(folderKey)` returns per-season pool or empty array when absent
- `types.ts`: `SeasonData` extended with `gearPool: GearPoolEntry[]` field
- `Loadout.tsx` + `Sample.tsx`: removed hardcoded Yomi import; use `season.gearPool` (empty for v2_narrow → GearGrid shows empty slots, correct behavior)
- `GearGrid.tsx`: removed hardcoded "Yomi Season" subtitle from Gear Slots header (was misleading for non-Yomi seasons)
- `Sample.tsx` banner text updated to not reference Yomi explicitly
- TODO(drax) comments added in useSeasonData + both pages for cleanup when engine ships gear pools

Rationale for Approach A over B: B only patches v2_narrow; A fixes the root cause for all future seasons. The glob infrastructure cost is minimal (Vite eager import), and the empty-array fallback is the correct behavior for pre-gear-pool seasons. No placeholder data needed.

**Item 2 — Analytics investigation + fix:**

Root cause (confirmed): v2_narrow WAS being collected by `useSeasonData` (globbed via manifest) and processed by `useAnalytics`. It fell into `historicalCards` in `SeasonSummaryCards.tsx` (not `isCanonical7`, not `season_002328`). But the section header was "Historical (canonical-4)" — misleading for v2_narrow, and `seasonLabel()` returned raw "v2_narrow" (no human-readable mapping).

Data shape inspection: `dominant_element: "physical"` on all classes (present), `anchor.name: "Moctezuma"` (present), `validation_passed: true` (present), `convergence_failures: 0` (present). All required analytics fields valid. NOT a data-shape problem.

Fix path chosen: (b) amend filter logic + (c) dedicated section:
- `useAnalytics.ts`: added `if (id === 'v2_narrow') return 'Narrow v1.0';` to `seasonLabel()`
- `SeasonSummaryCards.tsx`: added `isEngineV2Season(id)` predicate (`id === 'v2_narrow'`); v2_narrow excluded from historicalCards filter; new "Engine v2 — Narrow Milestone" section with amber styling + "pre-elemental · physical-only · new engine architecture" annotation
- `ClassIcon.tsx`: added `'v2_narrow': 'season-v2-narrow'` to iconMap (onError hides gracefully if SVG absent)

Why NOT Cycle 13 deferral (option d): the data is fully valid and v2_narrow IS being processed. The only issue was presentation — wrong section, raw label. A 5-line fix corrects both without touching data.

**Files changed:**
- `src/data/types.ts` — SeasonData.gearPool field added
- `src/hooks/useSeasonData.ts` — gearPoolModules glob + resolveGearPool + SeasonData construction
- `src/pages/Loadout.tsx` — hardcoded import removed; season.gearPool consumed
- `src/pages/Sample.tsx` — hardcoded import removed; season.gearPool consumed; banner text
- `src/components/GearGrid/GearGrid.tsx` — hardcoded "Yomi Season" subtitle removed
- `src/hooks/useAnalytics.ts` — v2_narrow seasonLabel mapping
- `src/components/analytics/SeasonSummaryCards.tsx` — isEngineV2Season predicate + dedicated section
- `src/components/ui/ClassIcon.tsx` — v2_narrow iconMap entry

**Smoke results:**
- `npm run build`: 813 modules, 0 TypeScript errors — PASS (both runs)
- Yomi (season_002328): gear pool unchanged — still resolved via glob, gearPool populated as before
- v2_narrow loadout view: gearPool = [] → GearGrid shows empty slots (correct; no gear_pool.json)
- Analytics page: v2_narrow appears in "Engine v2 — Narrow Milestone" section with label "Narrow v1.0", anchor "Moctezuma", theme "physical", validation PASS
- 11 historical seasons: unaffected; analyticsSeasons count now +1 (v2_narrow visible)
- No regression on historical gear display (Yomi gear pool still resolves correctly)

### Engine generation run loadout amendments (completed 2026-05-25)

**Dispatch:** `agentic_orchestration/dispatches/2026-05-25-drax-engine-generation-run-loadout-amendments.md`
**Tag:** `drax/v0.1-engine-generation-run-loadout-amendments-2026-05-25` (pending tag cut)
**Authority:** Matt 2026-05-25 parallel-fire with rocket engine generation run
**Push status:** PUSHED per skip-confirmation re-auth

**What shipped (4 items):**

1. **Amendment 1 — Design-mode toggle** (`src/components/DesignMode/DesignModePanel.tsx` + `DesignModeToggle.tsx`):
   - Global toggle in class picker row: "Player" / "Design" segmented button
   - Persisted via `localStorage` key `drax_design_mode`; default Player-mode always
   - Design-mode surfaces: `named_bearer` / `named_mythological_match` / `bc_target_cell` / `mechanical_substrate_triple` / `source_library` (labeled) / `converged_modifier` / `t4_alteration_output` raw struct (collapsible)
   - Cyan/teal visual treatment — distinct from violet (T4) and amber (M5 provenance)
   - Null-safe throughout (pre-v2.0 classes degrade to "—")
   - New types in `types.ts`: `BcTargetCell`, `MechanicalSubstrateTriple`, new optional ClassData fields

2. **Amendment 2 — Cultural / period / quality-tier badges** (`src/components/WeaponSlot/WeaponBadges.tsx`):
   - Woven into `WeaponSlot.tsx` below the weapon meta-row
   - Cultural badge: teal chip (`cultural_lineage_canonical`)
   - Period badge: slate chip (`historical_period_canonical`)
   - Quality-tier badge: emerald/lime/yellow/orange per S/A/B/C (`quality_tier`) — INFORMATIONAL only
   - Visually distinct from M5 ProvenanceBadge (amber/gray library provenance)
   - Always visible in Player-mode + Design-mode
   - Null-safe (pre-Cycle-12 weapons lack these fields; renders nothing when all three absent)
   - WeaponDescriptor in `types.ts` extended with 3 new optional nullable fields

3. **M1/M2/M5 verification + M2 gate-flip** (empirical inspection + flag flip):
   - M1 (`WeaponSlot.tsx`) VERIFIED shipped @ `f22a61f`
   - M2 (`OffHandSlot.tsx`) VERIFIED shipped; `SHOW_OFF_HAND_SLOT` flipped from `false` → `true`
   - M5 (`ProvenanceBadge.tsx`) VERIFIED shipped
   - **M2 gate-flip decision: FLIPPED** — Cycle 12 closed `v1.0-new-engine-ready`; rocket engine generation run lands v2.0 forms with `off_hand_contract` (Wave 5 42/42 PASS); T4 post-mortem benefits from full kit view

4. **Tier 3 — § 8 strategy badge** (`src/components/ui/StrategyBadge.tsx`):
   - Compact badge in ClassHeader archetype tag row; shows in both Player-mode + Design-mode
   - `§8` prefix + strategy label; color-coded per strategy type
   - Source: `classData.t4_alteration_output?.strategy_type` — null-safe
   - Included (not deferred): supports T4 post-mortem strategy distribution review

**Smoke results:**
- `npm run build`: 777 modules, 0 TypeScript errors — PASS
- Dev server: launches in 75ms, HTTP 200 — PASS
- Null-case: 11 real seasons (no new engine fields) — all degrade cleanly (design-mode shows "—"; WeaponBadges hides; StrategyBadge hides)
- Populated-case: class_0001 (sample-season, met_museum weapon + RESOURCE_CONVERSION): cultural badge (East Asian) + period badge (Medieval) + quality Tier S badge visible; design-mode shows bc_target_cell 5-tuple + mechanical_substrate_triple chips + converged_modifier + t4 raw expander
- Sketch F anchor case: class_0002 (Hattori Hanzo named_bearer): named_bearer visible in design-mode; WeaponBadges shows European / Classical / Tier A
- No regression: M3/M4/M5/M6 Spirit Guide narration chain unaffected; all pre-Cycle-12 classes null-safe

**Design decisions made:**
- Toggle placement: in class picker row (not top-of-page header, not per-card) — co-located with class picker for discoverability without visual dominance
- Toggle persistence: localStorage (session + cross-session); default Player-mode enforced by initial state
- `source_library` in design-mode: labeled row (explicit; distinct from M5 badge); M5 badge still shows in header (two surfaces, distinct framing)
- `mechanical_substrate_triple`: structured chips (element/weapon_kind/profile) — more scannable than raw object dump
- Quality-tier visual: emerald (S) / lime (A) / yellow (B) / orange (C) — clearly distinct from amber (M5 gap-fill) and teal (cultural badge)
- Strategy badge: color-coded per strategy type (red=resource, orange=trade-off, blue=element, green=defensive, violet=geometry, amber=def-tradeoff)
- Tier 3 INCLUDED: ~15min work, directly serves T4 post-mortem strategy distribution review, bundles cleanly

**TODO(drax): remove sample-season design-mode fixture enrichment** — class_0001 and class_0002 updated with synthesized v2.0 engine fields (bc_target_cell, mechanical_substrate_triple, converged_modifier, cultural_lineage_canonical, etc.). When rocket engine generation run completes and star-lord exports new forms, replace with real engine emission. Extends prior TODO(drax) for narration_metadata fixture.

### Cycle 12 Wave 5 — Spirit Guide narration L6 enrichment (completed 2026-05-25)

**Dispatch:** `agentic_orchestration/dispatches/2026-05-25-drax-cycle-12-wave-5-spirit-guide-narration-update.md`
**Tag:** `drax/cycle-12-wave-5-spirit-guide-narration-update-2026-05-25` @ commit `7699690`
**Upstream:** rocket Layer 6 `t4_wireup.py` emit_cross_seam_fields() + `rocket/v0.1-cycle-12-layer-6-section-8-wireup-and-l9-refactor-2026-05-25`
**MIGRATION.md:** v1.4-layer-6 (spirit_guide_narration_metadata emission shape)
**Preview URL:** https://reincarnated-loadout-bxdfu3igb-matthew-wetmore-s-projects.vercel.app
**Push status:** PUSHED — main + tag pushed to origin

**What shipped:**

1. **`src/data/types.ts`** — NarrationMetadata interface + T4AlterationOutput extension:
   - New `NarrationMetadata` interface per MIGRATION.md § v1.4-layer-6 / t4_wireup.py `_build_spirit_guide_narration()` shape:
     - `has_mechanic_alteration: boolean`
     - `alteration_type?: string | null`
     - `thematic_rationale?: string | null` (engine-generated, richer than Cycle 11 static)
     - `manifestation?: string | null`
     - `spirit_guide_explainer_template?: string | null`
     - `narrative_hooks?: string[]`
     - `secondary_alteration_types?: string[]`
   - `T4AlterationOutput.spirit_guide_narration_metadata?: NarrationMetadata | null` — additive nullable field
   - All null-safe; pre-L6 classes (absent field) degrade cleanly to Cycle 11 behavior

2. **`src/components/SkillTree/T4AlterationPanel.tsx`** — Spirit Guide narration fallback chain:
   - Fallback chain: L6 `narration_metadata.thematic_rationale` → Cycle 11 `thematic_rationale` → § 9 template voice
   - L6 explainer template label rendered as `text-[9px]` micro-label in Spirit Guide header row when present (e.g., "resource cost shift")
   - L6 narrative hooks rendered as small context chips below narration text when present (e.g., "sacrifice", "blood magic", "life wager")
   - Tier 2 framing maintained: "Build Identity" badge + "Intent Metadata" header — no Cycle 11 framing changed
   - Null-safe throughout: `narrationMeta?.thematic_rationale` pattern; `?? []` for hooks array

3. **`data/sample-season/classes/class_0001.json`** — fixture extended with `spirit_guide_narration_metadata`:
   - Populated with realistic L6-shape content for RESOURCE_CONVERSION: `has_mechanic_alteration: true`, `alteration_type`, `thematic_rationale` (richer prose than Cycle 11 `thematic_rationale`), `manifestation: "rank3_passive"`, `spirit_guide_explainer_template: "resource_cost_shift"`, `narrative_hooks: ["sacrifice", "blood_magic", "life_wager"]`, `secondary_alteration_types: []`
   - Exercises the populated-case path (L6 enrichment narration + explainer template label + narrative hook chips)

**Smoke results:**
- `npm run build`: 773 modules, 0 TypeScript errors — PASS (parity with Cycle 11 baseline)
- Null-case smoke: all 11 real seasons (no `t4_alteration_output`, no `spirit_guide_narration_metadata`) — T4AlterationPanel returns null, no broken UI (TypeScript type constraint + null guard verified)
- Populated-case smoke: `class_0001.json` (sample-season) with `spirit_guide_narration_metadata` → L6 narration path (richer prose renders), explainer template label visible, narrative hook chips render below narration text
- Tier 2 framing: "Build Identity" badge maintained; "Intent Metadata" label in M6 panel unaffected; no over-promising language introduced
- No regression: M1 (WeaponSlot), M2 (OffHandSlot), M4 (attribute coupling), M5 (ProvenanceBadge), M6 (T4ComparisonPanel) all unaffected
- Q5 RATIFIED: preview-only; production NOT promoted

**Design decisions made:**
- L6 explainer template rendered as informational micro-label (text-[9px], muted gray) in Spirit Guide header — visible but non-intrusive; doesn't compete with narration prose
- Narrative hooks rendered as small chips below narration text only when hooks array is non-empty — degrades cleanly to no chips for pre-L6 classes
- Fallback chain preserves Cycle 11 behavior exactly for pre-L6 classes: `narrationMeta` is null → `spiritGuideNarration` falls through to `alteration.thematic_rationale` → same behavior as Cycle 11 v1.0
- No new UI affordances beyond narration enrichment; all changes woven into existing M3 Spirit Guide box

**TODO(drax): remove sample-season narration_metadata fixture** — updated with synthesized L6-shape content. When rocket §8 + Layer 6 ships and season is regenerated, replace with real engine emission. Track until star-lord confirms regen + export complete. (Extends prior TODO for T4 fixture.)

### Cycle 11 M3 + M6 — T4 alteration display + comparison panel (completed 2026-05-25, Wave 3b)

**Dispatch:** `agentic_orchestration/dispatches/2026-05-25-drax-cycle-11-m3-m6-t4-display-wave-3b.md`
**Tag:** `drax/v0.1-cycle-11-m3-m6-t4-display-wave-3b-2026-05-25` @ commit `b948d3d`
**Intermediate tag:** `drax/v0.0-cycle-11-m3-t4-alteration-display-2026-05-25` @ `b948d3d`
**Upstream:** `star-lord/v0.1-cycle-11-schema-extensions-2026-05-25` (79/79 PASS)
**MIGRATION.md:** v1.3 (t4_alteration_output field; 4 additive nullable fields)
**Preview URL:** https://reincarnated-loadout-bc7s9pqpu-matthew-wetmore-s-projects.vercel.app
**Push status:** PUSHED — main + both tags pushed to origin

**What shipped:**

1. **`src/data/types.ts`** — T4AlterationOutput interface + T4StrategyType:
   - `T4StrategyType` union covering all 5 v1 strategies + forward-compat `string`
   - `T4AlterationOutput` interface: `strategy_type`, `strategy_params`, `applied_axis_targets?`, `eta_score?`, `thematic_rationale?`
   - `ClassData.t4_alteration_output` typed as `T4AlterationOutput | null` (was loose `Record<string,any>`)

2. **`src/components/SkillTree/T4AlterationPanel.tsx`** (M3):
   - Renders `t4_alteration_output` intent metadata below SkillTree grid
   - Header: strategy label (human-readable, not raw enum) + "Build Identity" badge + η-score
   - Body: mechanical strategy description (static template per strategy_type)
   - Parameters rendered as `label: value` pairs (friendly key labels)
   - BC axis tags rendered as small chips
   - Spirit-guide narration box (◈ icon): uses `thematic_rationale` from class JSON when present;
     falls back to § 9 template voice ("Summoner, you may have noticed...")
   - Null-safe: component returns null when alteration is null

3. **`src/components/SkillTree/T4ComparisonPanel.tsx`** (M6):
   - TOGGLE panel per Q2 RATIFIED (button with ▶ chevron; closed by default)
   - Current strategy shown with violet "selected" badge + η-score
   - 4 alternative strategies shown with static descriptions + "v1.1" placeholder for η-scores
   - Footer note: v1.1 will surface actual candidate scores when rocket §8 multi-candidate ships
   - Null-safe: toggle hidden entirely when alteration is null

4. **`src/components/SkillTree/SkillTree.tsx`** — wiring:
   - Imports T4AlterationPanel + T4ComparisonPanel
   - `t4Alteration = classData.t4_alteration_output ?? null` — null-safe extraction
   - Both panels conditionally rendered below tree/detail-panel row
   - Outer wrapper `<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">` wraps the full component

5. **`data/sample-season/classes/class_0001.json`** — smoke fixture:
   - Added `t4_alteration_output: RESOURCE_CONVERSION` with `strategy_params`, `applied_axis_targets`, `eta_score: 0.82`, and `thematic_rationale` (spirit-guide narration text)
   - This exercises the full render path for M3 + M6 + spirit-guide narration

**Tier 2 framing honored:** "Build Identity" badge on M3 header strip; "Intent Metadata" label in M6 panel header; M6 footer cites "Cycle 12 Layer 6" for combat wire-up.

**Design decisions made:**
- M3 goes BELOW the tree/detail-panel row (not inside the tree grid) — keeps the grid clean; alteration is a class-level identity, not per-skill
- Spirit-guide narration WOVEN INTO M3 panel (not a separate affordance) — per dispatch § 9 pattern; uses ◈ icon consistent with existing SpiritGuide component
- M6 toggle trigger: text button with ▶ chevron (`rotate-90` when open) — mobile-friendly tap target
- M6 comparison: current-only with static alternative descriptions (dispatch: lean toward current-only for v1 simplicity; multi-candidate deferred to v1.1)
- Violet accent color for T4 badge + current-alteration row in M6 — consistent with existing skill tier color register

**Smoke results:**
- `npm run build`: 773 modules, 0 TypeScript errors — PASS
- Vercel preview: `reincarnated-loadout-bc7s9pqpu-matthew-wetmore-s-projects.vercel.app` — READY
- Cycle-11+ path (class_0001, sample-season): RESOURCE_CONVERSION alteration renders M3 panel + M6 toggle + spirit-guide narration
- Null-case path: all 11 real seasons (no `t4_alteration_output`) — both panels hidden, no broken UI (null-guard verified by TypeScript type constraint)
- No regression: M1 (WeaponSlot), M2 (OffHandSlot), M4 (attribute coupling), M5 (ProvenanceBadge) all unaffected
- Q5 RATIFIED: preview-only; production NOT promoted

**TODO(drax): remove sample-season T4 fixture** — `data/sample-season/classes/class_0001.json` now has `t4_alteration_output` manually patched. When rocket §8 ships and season is regenerated, replace with real output. Track until star-lord confirms regen + export complete.

**TODO(drax): review M3 panel position** — currently M3 + M6 render below the SkillTree component's full row. Post-mortem: if Matt wants them in a different position in Loadout.tsx (e.g., as a separate section with its own header), easy to move — wiring is in SkillTree.tsx return, but could be lifted to Loadout.tsx instead.

### Cycle 11 M4 — Attribute coupling labels (completed 2026-05-25, Wave 3a refire)

**Dispatch:** `agentic_orchestration/dispatches/2026-05-25-drax-cycle-11-m4-attribute-coupling-labels-refire.md`
**Tag:** `drax/v0.0-cycle-11-m4-attribute-coupling-labels-2026-05-25-refire`
**Upstream:** `rocket/v0.0-cycle-11-attribute-coupling-field-2026-05-25` @ `eef66b1` (5/5 PASS)
**MIGRATION.md:** `~/Games/reincarnated-engine/src/reincarnated/generation/MIGRATION.md` § [2026-05-25]

**What shipped:**

1. **`src/data/types.ts`** — `attribute_coupling?: string[]` optional field added to `ClassData` interface:
   - Field comment cites MIGRATION.md [2026-05-25] + null-safety pattern
   - Optional (absent key on pre-Cycle-11 legacy seasons)

2. **`src/components/StatsPanel/StatsPanel.tsx`** — Coupling label row:
   - `formatCoupledStat()` helper: maps lowercase stat name → `STAT_LABELS` abbreviation (INT, WIS, etc.)
   - `attributeCoupling = classData.attribute_coupling ?? []` — null-safe for absent-key legacy seasons
   - Renders `Coupled: INT + WIS` row (using `text-violet-400` for stat values; `text-gray-500` for "Coupled:" label)
   - Conditionally rendered: `{attributeCoupling.length > 0 && (...)}` — renders nothing for legacy classes
   - Placement: between stat bars block and SP Budget section within StatsPanel card

3. **`data/sample-season/classes/class_0001.json`** — Added `attribute_coupling: ["intelligence", "wisdom"]` for Cycle-11+ smoke path verification (derived from stat_distribution top-2: INT=101, WIS=98)

**Label phrasing design decision:** `"Coupled: INT + WIS"` — abbreviated form using existing `STAT_LABELS` constants (3-letter uppercase codes). Matches the terse monospace font register of the stat bar labels. Avoids expanded form ("Couples with Intelligence + Wisdom") which would be wider than the stat block column on mobile. Rendered in violet-400 to match the stat bar fill color (`bg-violet-600`), creating visual cohesion.

**Smoke results:**
- `npm run build`: 771 modules, 0 TypeScript errors (clean) — PASS
- Cycle-11+ path: `class_0001.json` (sample-season) now has `attribute_coupling: ["intelligence", "wisdom"]` → renders `Coupled: INT + WIS` (confirmed by type-safe build + logic trace)
- Legacy path: season_001001 class_0001 has no `attribute_coupling` key → `?? []` → `length === 0` → no label, no broken UI (confirmed by empirical key-check: `'attribute_coupling' in d == False`)
- No regression: all 11 existing seasons' classes have absent field → null-guard path exercises cleanly

**TODO(drax): remove sample-season fixture patch** — `data/sample-season/classes/class_0001.json` manually patched with `attribute_coupling`. When engine regen fires post-Cycle-11, replace with real output. Track until star-lord confirms regen + export complete.

### Cycle 11 M1 + M2 + M5 — Weapon slots + provenance badge (completed 2026-05-25)

**Dispatch:** `agentic_orchestration/dispatches/2026-05-25-drax-cycle-11-m1-m2-m5-loadout-display.md`
**Tag:** `drax/v0.1-cycle-11-m1-m2-m5-loadout-display-2026-05-25` @ commit `f22a61f`
**Upstream:** `star-lord/v0.1-cycle-11-schema-extensions-2026-05-25` (79/79 PASS)
**MIGRATION.md:** v1.3 (star-lord Wave 1, 4 additive nullable fields)

**Intermediate tags:**
- `drax/v0.0-cycle-11-m5-provenance-badge-2026-05-25` @ `2823dc1`
- `drax/v0.0-cycle-11-m1-weapon-slot-2026-05-25` @ `e402f7b`
- `drax/v0.0-cycle-11-m2-off-hand-slot-2026-05-25` @ `e402f7b`

**What shipped:**

1. **M5 — ProvenanceBadge** (`src/components/ui/ProvenanceBadge.tsx`):
   - Consumes `source_library` string field (class-level)
   - `engine_authored_gap_fill_v1` → amber badge with "Engine fill" label (distinct per Q1 RATIFIED)
   - All other substrate libraries (met_museum, fextralife_ds2, odin_army_tradoc, wikidata_named_weapon) → neutral gray badge
   - Null-safe: returns null when source_library is null/undefined

2. **M1 — WeaponSlot** (`src/components/WeaponSlot/WeaponSlot.tsx`):
   - Consumes `main_weapon` WeaponDescriptor from class JSON
   - Renders: slot label, weapon name, category badge, cultural_register, period (underscore-replaced), lineage (nullable)
   - Embeds ProvenanceBadge from weapon.source_library (weapon-level provenance)
   - Null-safe: returns null when weapon is null

3. **M2 — OffHandSlot** (`src/components/WeaponSlot/OffHandSlot.tsx`):
   - Consumes `secondary_item` WeaponDescriptor from class JSON
   - Wraps WeaponSlot with "Off-Hand" label
   - Q3 UI-staging: `SHOW_OFF_HAND_SLOT = false` during T4 post-mortem; component is fully built
   - Null-safe: returns null when secondary_item is null (ALWAYS-VALID null per schema)

4. **types.ts** — `WeaponDescriptor` interface + Cycle 11 optional fields on ClassData:
   - `main_weapon?: WeaponDescriptor | null`
   - `secondary_item?: WeaponDescriptor | null`
   - `source_library?: string | null`
   - `t4_alteration_output?: Record<string, any> | null` (M3 gated — DO NOT render yet)

5. **Loadout.tsx wiring:**
   - ProvenanceBadge added to archetype tag row in ClassHeader (class-level source_library)
   - WeaponSlot + OffHandSlot section between ClassHeader and SkillTree; collapses when both null
   - Section renders only when `classData.main_weapon || classData.secondary_item` is truthy

6. **Smoke fixtures** (sample-season):
   - `class_0001`: met_museum main_weapon (polearm), null secondary_item, met_museum source_library
   - `class_0002`: engine_authored_gap_fill_v1 main_weapon + secondary_item (melee + talisman), gap-fill source_library

**Smoke results:**
- `npm run build`: 771 modules, 0 TypeScript errors (clean)
- Dev server: starts in 197ms, no console errors
- All pre-Cycle-11 classes (no main_weapon/secondary_item/source_library fields) handled by optional typing — null-guard paths verified
- Chunk size warning is pre-existing (Recharts); no new issue

**TODO(drax): SHOW_OFF_HAND_SLOT = true for v1.0 production launch** (Q3 RATIFIED)
- File: `src/components/WeaponSlot/OffHandSlot.tsx`, line 18
- Flip constant to `true` when v1.0 production launch authorized
- Remove TODO comment and staging gate comment at same time

**Deferred (out of scope this Wave):**
- M3 (T4 alteration panel): gated on rocket §8 + BC-shift sweep PASS
- M4 (attribute_coupling labels): gated on rocket attribute_coupling field landing
- M6 (T4 comparison panel): gates on M3

### /pitch page Phase-1 scaffold (completed 2026-05-18)

**Dispatch:** `agentic_orchestration/gandalf/requests/2026-05-18-star-lord-pitch-to-life-vercel-automation-sprint.md` § 2.3
**Commit:** `fda1a2a` — `feat(drax-loadout): /pitch page scaffold (Pattern A)`
**Preview URL:** https://reincarnated-loadout-9p1dedmlh-matthew-wetmore-s-projects.vercel.app/pitch
**Pitch URL:** https://reincarnated-loadout-9p1dedmlh-matthew-wetmore-s-projects.vercel.app/pitch

**New files:**
- `src/pages/Pitch.tsx` — page composition
- `src/components/pitch/HeroOfEngineSpotlight.tsx`
- `src/components/pitch/SeasonHypePiece.tsx`
- `src/components/pitch/CosmologyPairBlock.tsx`
- `src/components/pitch/SlotFillChipRow.tsx`
- `src/components/pitch/HeroPortraitPlaceholder.tsx`
- `src/components/pitch/PathsCards.tsx`
- `src/data/pitch/pitchData.ts`

**Modified:** `src/App.tsx` (route), `src/components/Nav.tsx` (nav item)

**Data sources used:**
- Hero class names + season assignments: gandalf curation `agentic_orchestration/gandalf/findings/2026-05-18-pitch-top-hero-curation.md`
- Cosmological pair-rationale prose + slot-fills: real engine output `reincarnated-engine/output/standard-demo-regen-2026-05-17/season_00201{1..5}/cosmological_vocabulary.json`
- star-lord's `seasons.json` included (already at `src/data/pitch/seasons.json` when commit ran)

**Phase 2 requirements (for star-lord):**
- Portrait pipeline to produce `public/pitch/heroes/<season_id>/<class_slug>.png` + `public/pitch/heroes-manifest.json`
- On manifest delivery: drax Phase 2 swaps HeroPortraitPlaceholder for real `<img>` at all TODO(drax) swap-points

**TODO(drax) entries (all Phase 2 swap-points):**
- `src/components/pitch/HeroPortraitPlaceholder.tsx` — swap for `<img>` when portraits land
- `src/pages/Pitch.tsx` — Phase 2 swap comment at import block
- `src/data/pitch/pitchData.ts` — replace inline data with seasons.json import + heroes-manifest.json consumption

**Smoke:** `npm run build` clean — 768 modules, 0 TypeScript errors

### v1.17 loadout side-car — is_retired filter (completed 2026-05-18)

**Dispatch:** `2026-05-18-drax-v1-17-auto-cast-plus-dungeon-objects-plus-is-retired-filter.md` Block 3
**Source:** rocket v1.17 canonical-6 is_retired backfill (17 hybrid_mage instances across seasons 002011-002015)

**Changes:**
- `src/data/types.ts`: added `is_retired?: boolean` and `retirement_reason?: string` to ClassData interface
- `src/pages/Loadout.tsx`: `classes` filtered to exclude `is_retired === true` before class-select
- `src/pages/Sample.tsx`: same filter applied
- `npm run build` clean (loadout)

**Effect:** hybrid_mage classes (17 instances) no longer appear in the loadout class selector for affected seasons.

---

### v1.1 Website refresh — new seasons + seasonal analytics (completed 2026-05-17)

**Dispatch:** `2026-05-17-drax-loadout-website-refresh-new-seasons-and-analytics.md` — COMPLETE
**Tag:** `drax/v1.1-loadout-website-refresh-new-seasons-and-analytics-1`
**Source:** `reincarnated-engine/output/standard-demo-regen-2026-05-17/` (5 seasons 002011-002015)

**Data layer:** 11 seasons total / 114 classes now in `data/`
- Historical (canonical-4): season_001001, 001002, 001003, 001004, 001005
- Canonical-7 (lightning/holy/shadow added): season_002011, 002012, 002013, 002014, 002015
- Yomi (gear-pool season): season_002328
- `useSeasonData` auto-discovers via `import.meta.glob` — no hook changes needed beyond `selectableSeasons` addition

**Analytics refresh (`src/pages/Analytics.tsx` + hooks + 2 new components):**

1. **SeasonSummaryCards** (`src/components/analytics/SeasonSummaryCards.tsx`) — per-season card grid:
   - Three groups: Historical / Canonical-7 / Yomi
   - Per card: label, C7 badge, PASS/FAIL validation, theme element (colored dot), anchor name, class count, convergence failures, avg modifier, substrate chips (* = new canonical-7)
   - Canonical-7 new-substrate callout per card when lightning/holy/shadow present

2. **SubstrateHeatmap** (`src/components/analytics/SubstrateHeatmap.tsx`) — cross-season substrate count table:
   - Rows = seasons (C7 seasons left-border highlighted, violet C7 label)
   - Columns = all substrates (fire/water/earth/wind/lightning/holy/shadow/physical)
   - Cell intensity scales to max observed count; color-coded by substrate hue
   - Columns marked * for canonical-7 substrates

3. **useAnalytics additions:**
   - `SeasonSummaryCard`, `SubstrateHeatmapRow` types
   - `seasonSummaryCards`, `substrateHeatmap`, `allSubstrates`, `newSubstrateSet` fields
   - `isCanonical7Season()` helper identifies 002011-002015

4. **Analytics.tsx:**
   - New canonical-7 callout banner (violet, above summary cards)
   - `NewSubstratesBadge` in summary strip (shows "lightning · holy · shadow")
   - SeasonSummaryCards + SubstrateHeatmap inserted above existing Tier 1 charts
   - Existing 9 charts fully preserved

5. **Season pickers (Loadout.tsx + Sample.tsx):**
   - `selectableSeasons` added to `useSeasonData` return
   - Dropdown at page top; class resets on season change
   - Works across all 11 real seasons (sample-season alias excluded from picker)

6. **constants.ts extensions:**
   - `ELEMENT_COLORS`: added lightning (yellow), holy (violet), shadow (purple)
   - `ARCHETYPE_LABEL`: added lightning_mage, lightning_controller, holy_caster, holy_controller, shadow_mage, shadow_controller, physical_grappler

**Smoke results:**
- `npm run build`: clean (0 TypeScript errors, 760 modules)
- Bundle size: 2,315 KB minified / 469 KB gzip — grew ~1.5 KB from 51 new class JSONs (within expectations)
- CourtBrowser.tsx: untouched; court.json bootstrap path intact
- Encounters.tsx: untouched (fixed to season_001005 encounter analytics data)
- Vercel deploy size: OBSERVATION — pre-existing chunk warning (Recharts), no new issue

**Note on season_001005:** Was absent from loadout data (only 001001-004 were present). Sourced from `reincarnated-engine/seasons/season_001005/` (not the standard-demo-regen-2026-05-17 staging dir). Now present alongside the other historical seasons.

### D17 Court of Forms browser surface (completed 2026-05-17)

**Dispatch:** `2026-05-17-drax-loadout-d17-court-browser-surface.md` — COMPLETE
**Tag:** `drax/v1.0-d17-court-browser-surface-1` (significant version bump; loadout-side D17 milestone)
**Route:** `/court` (new nav tab "Court")
**MIGRATION.md:** §v1.2
**Hive log entries:** STATE + QUESTION (rocket export step) + HANDOFF (drax-demo) appended

**Architecture decision: Path A static export** (documented in MIGRATION.md §v1.2)
- Engine (rocket) writes JSON snapshot to `~/.config/reincarnated/court_export.json`
- Loadout reads from `public/data/court.json` (bootstrap empty file in place)
- Path B (API) and Path C (SQLite file-watch) rejected — disproportionate for local-first Phase-1 P1
- QUESTION filed → rocket: add `Court.export_json(earth_self_id, output_path)` to `court_persistence.py`

**What shipped (5 items):**

1. **Architecture decision** — Path A static export; documented in MIGRATION.md §v1.2 including
   QUESTION to rocket for the missing export step.

2. **Court data consumption layer:**
   - `src/data/courtTypes.ts` — TypeScript types mirroring Python dataclasses (`CourtForm`,
     `CourtSkill`, `CourtVisualSignature`, `CourtExport`); `SUBSTRATE_COLORS` (all 7 canonical
     substrates); `SUBSTRATE_GROUPING_LABEL`, `PATH_TAKEN_LABEL`, `COURT_ROLE_LABEL`
   - `src/hooks/useCourtData.ts` — React hook; discriminated union state (loading/empty/ready/error);
     graceful empty-Court handling; forms sorted season ASC on load

3. **Court browser UI (`src/pages/CourtBrowser.tsx`):**
   - Card grid (1→2→3→4 col responsive)
   - Substrate filter toggles (grouping_label display; "all" default)
   - Search by form_name (substring, case-insensitive)
   - Sort: season ASC/DESC, substrate, name
   - N=5 recency indicator (accent-color "recent" badge on most recently ascended forms)
   - Sprite thumbnails from vfx-manifest.json v1.1 `thumbnail_frame.file` paths; `onError` graceful degradation
   - All 7 substrate colors visible (SUBSTRATE_COLORS extension of v0.28 palette)
   - Per-card: form_name (full, per C3), season, archetype, role, class_role_function,
     iconic skill, path_taken, court_resonance strip
   - Empty state: canonical voice copy ("Your Court will populate as you ascend forms across seasons")
   - Loading + error states

4. **Cross-seam reference update:**
   - `MIGRATION.md §v1.2` authored (architecture decision + schema + consumer responsibilities)
   - `AGENT_STATE.md` updated (this entry)
   - Bootstrap `public/data/court.json` created (empty envelope; triggers empty state)

5. **Hive log + tag:**
   - STATE entry appended
   - QUESTION → rocket (export_json() needed)
   - HANDOFF → drax-demo (informational; Court browser live in loadout)
   - Tag: `drax/v1.0-d17-court-browser-surface-1`

**New files:**
- `src/data/courtTypes.ts` — Court TypeScript types + substrate palette
- `src/hooks/useCourtData.ts` — React hook for court.json consumption
- `src/pages/CourtBrowser.tsx` — Court browser UI page
- `public/data/court.json` — bootstrap empty envelope (Path A consumer path)

**Modified files:**
- `src/App.tsx` — added `/court` route + CourtBrowser import
- `src/components/Nav.tsx` — added "Court" nav tab
- `MIGRATION.md` — §v1.2 appended
- `AGENT_STATE.md` — this entry

**Smoke results:**
- `npm run build`: 690 modules, 0 TypeScript errors (clean)
- court.json: valid JSON, empty envelope, graceful empty state path verified by type
- Substrate colors: all 7 substrates have explicit Tailwind literal classes (no safelist additions needed)
- Sprite thumbnail paths: `onError` degradation means broken paths don't crash the page
- Build chunk size warning is pre-existing (Recharts); no new issue

**TODO(drax): remove Path A bootstrap** — when rocket ships `export_json()` and first export
is produced, the empty `public/data/court.json` gets replaced with real data. Then the empty
state is no longer the default path. Track until rocket HANDOFF confirms export step live.

**TODO(drax): Frostwindz guard preserved** — Frostwindz Deathbringer is `denied_uses: ["court_portrait_full_screen"]`.
Court card thumbnails use `chierit/shadow_stalker/gif_samples/e_idle.gif` for shadow (not Frostwindz).
No Frostwindz paths referenced in CourtBrowser.tsx. Guard intact.

### D19 Sub-phase B-partial: holy VFX gap closed + Frostwindz ingested + earth deferred (completed 2026-05-17)

**Hive-mode D19 Sub-phase B-partial.** Matt landed two vendor packs on-disk: CreativeKind Holy Spell Effects + Frostwindz Deathbringer. CraftPix Premium + Fellor Crystal DEFERRED to Phase-2 per Matt L3 disposition 2026-05-17.
**Tag:** `drax/v0.24-d19-sub-phase-b-partial-holy-frostwindz-1`
**Loadout commit:** `3b17175` (data/vfx-manifest.json v1.1 + MIGRATION.md §v1.1)
**Demo commit:** `103ed6c` (metadata.json for both packs)
**Hive log entries:** STATE + HANDOFF + OBSERVATION (appended after commit)

**What shipped:**

1. **CreativeKind Holy Spell Effects metadata.json** (`Holy_Spell_Effects_Creativekind/metadata.json`):
   - 13 animation slugs (Spell 1–13) with geometry_type + affinity mapping
   - derived_register: hand-drawn-pixel (VERIFIED — HD-resolution spritesheets, smooth digital painting)
   - All 5 PREFER holy geometries mapped (radiant_aura, shaft, nova, ground_targeted_circle, area_sustain)
   - 52 assets (26 preview GIFs + 26 spritesheets); 9 color variants for Spell 4 (radiant_aura)

2. **Frostwindz Deathbringer metadata.json** (`Deathbringer VFX/metadata.json`):
   - derived_register: 16-bit-shaped-pixel (CONFIRMED retro-pixel by visual inspection)
   - permitted_uses: [ui_thumbnail, loadout_static, substrate_browser_thumbnail, trial_cinematic_redraw_source]
   - denied_uses: [in_combat_vfx, court_portrait_full_screen] per gandalf DECISION [2026-05-18 00:00Z]
   - License: commercial-royalty-free (no attribution required; read from embedded docx)
   - 6 VFX animations; 99 total frames across VFX 1-6
   - TODO(drax) guard preserved and strengthened

3. **vfx-manifest.json v1.1** (`data/vfx-manifest.json`):
   - schema_version: "1.0" → "1.1"
   - HOLY: primary_spell_pack set (creativekind-holy-spell-effects); geometry_animation_map populated (8 keys); acquisition_status entity-only-on-disk → on-disk; combat_vfx_ready: false → **true** (Discipline #12 semantic shift)
   - SHADOW (Frostwindz): acquisition_status pending-matt → on-disk; register_risk confirmed; permitted_uses/denied_uses set; NOT in geometry_animation_map (in-combat denied)
   - EARTH (CraftPix + Fellor): acquisition_status pending-matt → deferred-post-phase-1-p1; phase_2_followup notes added; stone-VFX fallback documented
   - New v1.1 fields: permitted_uses, denied_uses, register_risk (confirmed), phase_2_followup, gandalf_decision_ref, animation_preview, deferred-post-phase-1-p1 status value

4. **MIGRATION.md §v1.1** entry authored:
   - Semantic shift documentation (holy combat_vfx_ready false → true)
   - Frostwindz conditional-accept ingestion + TODO(drax) guard
   - Earth deferral disposition + Phase-2 followup
   - Schema field additions (backward-compatible)
   - Consumer responsibilities per seam (star-lord / rocket / drax)

**Smoke results:**
- vfx-manifest.json: parses clean (python3 -m json.tool)
- No Frostwindz entries in any geometry_animation_map (verified by script)
- All holy PREFER geometry affinities covered; no key drift vs § 6 declarations
- npm run build: succeeded (687 modules, 0 TS errors)

**Phase-2 followup queue (captured in manifest + state):**
1. CraftPix Premium wood-nature (earth biological-organic) — DEFERRED 2026-05-17 per Matt
2. Fellor Crystal Gem (earth crystal-gem) — DEFERRED 2026-05-17 per Matt; macOS Gatekeeper note on retry
3. CreativeKind shadow-tendril (shadow tendril/creep geometry) — catalogue-only; not yet authorized; needed for full shadow combat_vfx_ready

**Cross-seam observations:**
- Holy combat_vfx_ready now TRUE — rocket D17 Court browser holy thumbnail UNBLOCKED (new thumbnail: Spell 4_gold_red.gif)
- Shadow combat_vfx_ready remains FALSE — Frostwindz is UI-only; tendril/creep PREFER geometries still absent
- Earth stone-VFX fallback is functional for Phase-1 P1 ship (graceful degradation)

**TODO(drax): Frostwindz Deathbringer** — do NOT wire to in-combat VFX. Register CONFIRMED retro-pixel. UI thumbnails only. Explicit gandalf exception required to override DECISION [2026-05-18 00:00Z]. Guard in metadata.json AND vfx-manifest.json shadow.supplementary_packs.

### D19 Sub-phase A: chierit extraction + vfx-manifest.json + MIGRATION.md (completed 2026-05-18)

**Hive-mode D19 Sub-phase A.** Deliverable 19 VFX library extension — Sub-phase A.
**Tag:** `drax/v0.23-d19-sub-phase-a-chierit-extraction-manifest-1`
**Loadout commit:** `f659c90` (MIGRATION.md + data/vfx-manifest.json)
**Demo commit:** `c5d8a40` (public/assets/chierit/ — 4,211 files, 10 character packs)
**Hive log entries:** STATE start, milestone x2, HANDOFF to jack-ryan (WP-4a close), QUESTION to star-lord

**What shipped:**

1. **Chierit extraction** (`reincarnated-demo/public/assets/chierit/`):
   - 10 ZIPs extracted from `Elementals_bundle/` to `chierit/<character_slug>/`
   - Path convention: normalized lowercase slug; vendor-original internal structure preserved
   - 3,841 PNGs + 357 GIFs; all 10 packs registered in vfx-manifest.json
   - Source ZIPs retained at `Elementals_bundle/` (originals preserved)

2. **`data/vfx-manifest.json`** — new cross-seam VFX data contract (schema v1.0):
   - 7 substrates: fire/water/earth/wind/lightning/holy/shadow
   - Per-substrate: grouping_label, primary_spell_pack, geometry_animation_map, entity_packs, thumbnail_frame, acquisition_status, combat_vfx_ready
   - geometry_animation_map keys match substrate-identity-declarations geometry_affinities names
   - Frostwindz: register_risk + permitted_uses/denied_uses per gandalf DECISION [2026-05-18 00:00Z]
   - Combat VFX ready: fire/water/earth(stone)/wind/lightning
   - NOT READY: holy (entity-only; no spell VFX), shadow (void_pool only; tendril/creep absent)

3. **`MIGRATION.md`** — new file per jack-ryan WP-4a:
   - First entry: §v1.0-vfx-manifest
   - Full schema documentation + consumer responsibilities per seam
   - geometry_animation_map key constraint documented (load-bearing for D15/D17)
   - Chierit extraction path convention table
   - Frostwindz conditional-accept disposition + TODO(drax) guard
   - Schema evolution notes for Sub-phases B + C

**Smoke results:**
- vfx-manifest.json: parses clean; all 7 substrates; 5 combat-ready; grouping_labels confirmed; Frostwindz risk documented
- loadout build: 687 modules, 0 TS errors (unchanged)
- chierit: 10 directories; 3,841 PNGs + 357 GIFs verified

**Cross-seam observations:**
- Star-lord D15/D17/D22: geometry_animation_map key naming is now committed. QUESTION to star-lord in hive log re: prompt-cipher schema alignment with manifest keys.
- Rocket D17: thumbnail_frame.file paths ready for Court browser substrate thumbnails.
- Jack-ryan WP-4a: MIGRATION.md authored. WP-4a should close.
- TODO(drax): Frostwindz Deathbringer — do NOT wire to in-combat VFX per gandalf DECISION. UI thumbnails only.

### D19-vfx-library-extension-plan (completed 2026-05-17 — PLANNING ONLY; no code changes)

**Hive-mode Track B.** Deliverable 19 VFX library extension — planning phase.
**Planning doc:** `agentic_orchestration/hive-mind/d19-vfx-library-extension-plan.md`
**Hive log entries:** 4 appended (STATE start, STATE complete, OBSERVATION x2, HANDOFF)
**Implementation status:** BLOCKED on Matt vendor acquisitions (CraftPix premium wood-nature + Fellor Crystal + Frostwindz Deathbringer)

**Key findings:**

On-disk VFX inventory (all 7 substrates assessed):
- Fire: ADEQUATE — pimen fire-spell-effect-3 (9 animation groups) + CreativeKind entities + chierit fire_knight ZIP
- Water: ADEQUATE — pimen water-spell-effect-03 (7 groups) + chierit water_priestess ZIP
- Earth: MODERATE GAP — stone adequate; crystal = Fellor pending; biological = CraftPix pending
- Wind: ADEQUATE — pimen wind-spell-effect-03 (12 groups, richest pack) + chierit ZIP
- Lightning: STRONG — pimen thunder-spell-effect-03 (~30 blur/no-blur variants) + CreativeKind Lightning x2 VFX + God_of_Lightning x2 + Lich lightning + chierit lightning_ronin ZIP
- Holy: SIGNIFICANT GAP — entity sprites only (Angel_Guardian, Angel_Mage, angel_v1; chierit light_valkyrie ZIP); ZERO holy spell VFX on-disk
- Shadow: PARTIAL — Dark_Hole VFX + entity sprites; tendril/drain geometry absent; Frostwindz Deathbringer pending with RETRO register RISK

**Critical observations:**
1. Frostwindz Deathbringer is likely RETRO-pixel (not HD-2D-conformant); wiring to combat VFX requires gandalf register exception — documented in plan § 2.3 + hive log OBSERVATION
2. Holy spell VFX is NOT covered by Matt's three authorized acquisitions; CreativeKind Holy Spell Effects (~$5-15) needed for holy combat rendering — surfaced as L3 OBSERVATION to knight-rider for Matt routing
3. Lightning is the best-covered new substrate — pimen thunder pack alone provides adequate geometry coverage; no additional acquisition blocking

**Sub-phase A READY (no Matt acquisitions required):**
- Chierit Elementals ZIP extraction (10 ZIPs: fire_knight, water_priestess, ground_monk, crystal_mauler, leaf_ranger, wind_hashashin, lightning_ronin, light_valkyrie, shadow_stalker, metal_bladekeeper)
- Author `reincarnated-demo/public/assets/vfx-manifest.json` per schema in plan § 4.4
- 1-2 day effort; dispatchable by knight-rider now

**VFX manifest schema proposed:** per-substrate JSON with `geometry_animation_map` keyed to substrate-identity-declarations geometry_affinities; `thumbnail_frame` for loadout substrate browser; `acquisition_status` field. Star-lord coordination needed (D17/D22/D15 key naming alignment).

**Effort estimate (implementation phase):** 6-9 days post-acquisitions:
- Sub-phase A: 1-2 days (now)
- Sub-phase B (acquisition intake + register verify): 0.5-1 day when Matt downloads
- Sub-phase C (demo VFX wiring + loadout D21/D22 + element badges): 4-6 days

**No production code modified.** Planning only.
**No tag cut** (doc-only session; no substantive loadout code change to tag per dispatch instruction: "skip tag if doc-only").

### v0.21-form-bias-stage-3-cipher-consumption (completed 2026-05-16)

**Dispatch:** `2026-05-16-drax-form-bias-stage-3-cipher-consumption.md`
**Commit:** `84487ea`
**Tag:** `drax/v0.21-form-bias-stage-3-cipher-consumption`
**Upstream:** `star-lord/v1.3-form-bias-stage-3-cipher-migration @ 19d8ba0`
**MIGRATION.md:** v1.2

**What changed:**

6 LEAK-RISK sites closed. Cipher migration consumption for star-lord Stage 3.

**L-06, L-07 — GearGrid.tsx:**
- Added `resolveGearElementName(item)` helper: `seasonal_dominant_element ?? dominant_element`
- Modal display (L-06) now renders `resolvedElName` (seasonal for v1.5+, canonical for pre-v1.5)
- Card cell display (L-07) now renders `resolvedElName.slice(0,4)` — same resolution
- `seasonal_dominant_element?: string | null` added to `GearPoolEntry` type

**L-12 — Loadout.tsx + Sample.tsx (ElementMappingBadges/ElementMappingRow):**
- Both components now call `buildElementBadgeEntries()` / `buildSampleElementEntries()`
- v1.5+ manifests: iterates `manifest.seasonal_elements` (grouping-layer keyed: ignition/suffusion/bulwark/displacement)
- Pre-v1.5 manifests: falls back to `CANONICAL_ORDER` iteration over `manifest.elements`
- Grouping key shown to player (not the canonical key) — semantic slot label
- Color lookup uses `canonicalKey` from `canonical_slot` (INTERNAL; not rendered as text)
- `assertManifestSeasonalFields(manifest)` called at entry point — field-presence assertion

**L-02 — SkillDetailPanel.tsx + SkillTree.tsx (resolveElementName hardening):**
- Added `resolveSkillElementName(skill, manifest)` in SkillDetailPanel: prefers `skill.seasonal_element` (v1.5+ direct), falls back to `resolveElementDisplay()`
- `resolveElementDisplay(canonical, manifest, context)` in types.ts: checks `seasonal_elements` (canonical_slot match), then `elements`, then warns + returns "Unknown" — never returns raw canonical-four
- Both SkillDetailPanel and SkillTree now use hardened resolver
- `seasonal_element?: string | null` added to `Skill` type

**L-13 — Loadout.tsx + Sample.tsx (dominantElementName):**
- `dominantElementName` now: `classData.seasonal_dominant_element ?? resolveElementDisplay(classData.dominant_element, manifest, ...)`
- Prefer direct field (v1.5+); fall through hardened resolver; never return raw canonical-four
- `seasonal_dominant_element?: string | null` added to `ClassData` type

**L-11 — constants.ts (archetype display labels):**
- Added `resolveArchetypeLabel(archetypeTag, manifest?)` function
- v1.5+ manifests: finds seasonal entry by `canonical_slot`, returns `{seasonalName} {RoleSuffix}` (e.g. "Pressure-Release Mage")
- Pre-v1.5 or non-elemental archetypes: returns static `ARCHETYPE_LABEL` value
- Loadout.tsx + Sample.tsx: all `ARCHETYPE_LABEL[...]` call sites replaced with `resolveArchetypeLabel(...)`. Unused `ARCHETYPE_LABEL` import removed.

**Types.ts additions:**
- `Skill.seasonal_element?: string | null`
- `ClassData.seasonal_dominant_element?: string | null`
- `GearPoolEntry.seasonal_dominant_element?: string | null`
- `SeasonManifest.seasonal_elements?: Record<string, SeasonalElementMapping> | null`
- `SeasonalElementMapping` interface (extends ElementMapping + adds `canonical_slot: string`)
- `assertManifestSeasonalFields(manifest)`: fail-loud WARN for v1.5+ missing seasonal_elements
- `resolveElementDisplay(canonical, manifest, context)`: hardened resolver (WARN + "Unknown" on both-missing)

**Test file written:** `src/__tests__/cipher-no-leak.test.ts` — 18 drax-side cipher guard tests.
BLOCKED on vitest devDependency (jack-ryan approval required before adding).
Type-level correctness enforced via `tsc -b` (0 errors).

**Smoke results:**
- All pre-v1.5 season manifests (v1.2 season_001001, v1.3 season_002328): 0 canonical-four leaks via resolveElementDisplay (fire→pitch/lantern, water→brine, earth→basalt/bone, wind→thrum/miasma)
- Simulated v1.5 fixture: fire→Pressure-Release, wind→Veil, water→Churn, earth→Grit (all via seasonal_elements)
- Gear items (74/200 with element): pre-v1.5 fallback shows canonical-four — EXPECTED for pre-Stage-3 season data. Will resolve to seasonal names when v1.5 export ships.
- Build: clean (687 modules, 0 TS errors)

**Known follow-on (NOT in this dispatch scope):**
- `reincarnated-demo/src/ui/classSelector.ts:147` — `cls.dominant_element` rendered as player-visible text (discovered during audit; outside the 6 enumerated L-sites). Track as demo-side LEAK-RISK for next cipher dispatch.
- Loadout vitest gap — add to jack-ryan approval queue when sequencing allows.
- v1.5 season data not yet exported — star-lord Stage 3 shipped code but no regen yet. Gear items will show canonical-four until a v1.5 season export replaces season_002328 data.

**Spirit Guide voice audio unblocked:** YES — all 6 player-visible canonical-four LEAK-RISK sites on the loadout app are closed. gandalf audio framework dependency D2 is satisfied.

**Build:** Clean (0 TS errors, 687 modules)
**Tag:** `drax/v0.21-form-bias-stage-3-cipher-consumption` (commit 84487ea) — intermediate

### v0.8-gear-wiring (completed, this session)

1. **Gear tab wired** — `Loadout.tsx` now imports `gear_pool.json` from `season_002328`, calls `synthesizeSampleLoadout(classData, gearPool)` via `useMemo` (re-runs on class change), and passes `mode="sample"` + `synthesized={synthesizedGear}` to `<GearGrid />`. Same fit-score formula as `Sample.tsx`: fit = (energy_type × range_profile × role_orientation)^(1/3).

2. **`data/telemetry.db` gitignored** — added `data/telemetry.db` to `.gitignore`. Large local data file, not for VCS.

**Build:** Clean (0 TS errors, 686 modules)
**Tag:** `drax/v0.8-gear-wiring` (commit fe8b810) — intermediate
**Preview:** https://reincarnated-loadout-g3v3ffhry-matthew-wetmore-s-projects.vercel.app

---

### v0.5-real-gear (completed, prev session)
- Retired all synthesized gear types (`GearEffectPoolEntry`, `RolledEffect`, `GearCatalog`, `SynthesizedSlot`, `formatEffect.ts`)
- Added `GearPoolEntry`, `LoadoutSlot` types matching real engine schema
- Implemented fit-score gear selector: `fit = (energy_type × range_profile × role_orientation)^(1/3); value = power_score × fit`
- Display slots → engine slots: Main=weapon/0, Off=off_hand/0, Head=armor/0, Chest=armor/1, Neck=accessory/0, Ring1=accessory/1, Ring2=accessory/2
- GearGrid: full tier badge palette (legendary/epic/rare/uncommon/common), real names + flavor text
- "Gear — synthesized" retired → "Gear — Yomi Season"
- Loadout page now shows real gear (was empty mode before)

### v0.6-encounter-viz (completed, prev session)
- New `/encounters` route with 4th nav tab
- Two-panel SVG schematic: AOE vs pack (left) + single-target vs pack (right)
- 3 Yomi classes: Lantern-Keeper (AOE), Miasma Warden (AOE), Hollow Wind Ascetic (no AOE)
- Pack N=8 (design-intent placeholder per B10.2; exact value locked by gamora)
- Geometry inferred from `effect_category` (area_damage → circle, others → point)
  - `// TODO: wire B11 geometry field when rocket ships it` — comment in Encounters.tsx
- AOE overlay: skill's `color_value` brightened (+100/channel) for dark UI visibility
- Single-target: ring highlight + tick indicator on closest pack member
- `Skill.color_value: number` added to types.ts (confirmed real engine field)

### v0.6.5-analytics-tier3 (completed, this session)

**Tier 3 analytics charts** — all three from design-doc sections 5, 7, 8:

1. **StatRadarChart** (`src/components/analytics/StatRadarChart.tsx`)
   - Recharts RadarChart showing avg stat allocation per archetype as % of 270-point budget
   - Dropdown to select archetype; violet overlay for selected, gray overlay for global avg
   - All 5 stats: STR, DEX, INT, WIS, VIT

2. **SeasonTimelineChart** (`src/components/analytics/SeasonTimelineChart.tsx`)
   - Recharts LineChart: avg final_modifier per season, chronological by generated_at
   - Hover tooltip shows anchor name, modifier value, class count
   - Reference line at overall avg; honest caption that modifier doesn't trend monotonically across disconnected seeds

3. **SkillTierChart** (`src/components/analytics/SkillTierChart.tsx`)
   - Recharts stacked horizontal BarChart: avg skill count per tier (T1-T4) per archetype
   - Only Yomi season (season_002328) has tier field in skills — older seasons silently skipped
   - Caption explicitly states Yomi-only scope

**useAnalytics additions:**
- `StatRadarEntry`, `SeasonTimelinePoint`, `SkillTierBar` types
- Computations: statRadarEntries, globalStatAvg, seasonTimeline, skillTierBars
- `AnalyticsData` interface extended with 4 new fields

**Tailwind safelist trim** (`tailwind.config.js`):
- Replaced broad catch-all pattern safelist (covered ~500+ classes) with 5 specific literals
- Only classes genuinely needing protection: bg-orange/teal/blue/amber-600, bg-slate-500
  (runtime result of `elColors.bg.replace('950','600').replace('800','500')` in SkillNode.tsx)
- All other element/tier/state colors are string literals → Tailwind scans without safelist

**CC-BY footer** (`src/App.tsx`):
- Added `<Footer />` component at bottom of every route
- Attributes game-icons.net (Lorc, Delapouite & contributors) under CC BY 3.0 with live links
- Previously attribution was in commit messages only

### v0.5.2-stats-and-slot (completed, this session)

1. **Bug A — Slot/flavor mismatch**: Modal slot label now uses `ENGINE_SLOT_LABEL[slot.engineSlot]` instead of `SLOT_TYPE_LABEL[displayLabel]`. Both Head/Chest positions show "Armor" — honest about engine's single armor pool. "Miasma Shroud of Yomi" robe now shows "Armor" not "Helmet".

2. **Bug 5 — Stats display**: Wired `stats`, `rolled_effects`, `ability_modifiers` from MIGRATION.md v1.1. Modal shows cyan stat lines, yellow effect lines, violet modifier lines. `buildStatLines()`, `fmtEffect()`, `fmtModifier()` helper functions.

3. **Bug B — Element on card cell**: `dominant_element` shown as small colored text on card cell below tier abbreviation. 126/200 items have null element — badge optional.

4. **types.ts**: Added `GearStats`, `GearRolledEffect` interfaces; fixed pre-existing nullable type errors (`color_signature`, `flavor_text`, `visual_prompt`). Fixed `Sample.tsx` cast to `as unknown as GearPoolEntry[]`.

**Preview:** https://reincarnated-loadout-7uokkvr61-matthew-wetmore-s-projects.vercel.app

## Confirmed findings

- `role: "primary_attack"` is a real engine field (confirmed from class JSON; not a UI heuristic)
- `Skill.color_value` is a real engine field (RGB integer, calibrated for Pixi.js; dark for Yomi palette)
- `stat_requirements: null` for all 200 Yomi gear items
- Older season skills (season_001001–004) lack `tier` field — schema pre-dates skill tree tier structure
- `stat_distribution` sums to exactly 270 across all seasons (confirmed budget constraint)
- `final_modifier` range: 0.05–0.88 across all seasons (not > 1.0)
- No `origin` remote configured in loadout repo — push steps skipped

### v0.7-encounter-analytics (completed, this session)

**Multi-dimensional centroid + stdev-ellipse encounter analytics:**

- `data/encounter_analytics.json` — pre-computed fight aggregates from season_001005 (11 classes, 22 encounter slots, 230 (class × monster) pairs)
  - Generated via `/tmp/gen_encounter_analytics.py` querying `data/telemetry.db`
  - Tier-1 columns (duration_seconds, a_heals_received, a_potions_used) are NULL for all existing rows — marked tier1_populated: false
  - Geometry mix per class computed from abilities table (AOE / single / buff percentages)
  - Win rate and stdev(damage) per (class, monster) pair

- `src/hooks/useEncounterAnalytics.ts` — typed hook; global damage extent; by-slot index
- `src/pages/Encounters.tsx` — full v0.7 replacement of v0.6 static SVG:
  - **View 1** (default): per-class small multiples, one point per encounter slot
  - **View 2**: per-encounter-slot small multiples, one point per class
  - SVG scatter plots: centroid dot + stdev ellipse per (class × encounter-slot) pair
  - Projection: Damage Dealt × Win Rate (Tier-1 pending; TODO switches to Damage × TTK once gamora Option 2 regen ships)
  - Divergence ceiling: WR < 25% flagged red ⚑ (Lock 2 threshold)
  - View A interpretation callout (locked 2026-05-16 per decisions-log)
  - No new npm dependencies — pure React + SVG

**v0.6 promote-or-retire decision:** Option (a) — rolled v0.6 into v0.7; v0.6 intermediate tag `drax/v0.6-encounter-viz` retained as history; v0.7 gets the milestone tag (pending Matt).

**Tag:** `drax/v0.7-encounter-analytics` (commit 1949def) — intermediate
**Preview:** https://reincarnated-loadout-fqcfcam6s-matthew-wetmore-s-projects.vercel.app

### v0.7.1-skill-gate-fix (completed, this session)

1. **Skill gate bug (FIXED)** — `unlockRules.ts`: `spInTiersBelow` and `isTierUnlocked` now accept optional `chainId` parameter. `canInvest` uses `skill.chain_id` so each chain's T2/T3/T4 unlocks independently based only on that chain's lower-tier SP. `SkillTree.tsx`: `getNodeState` passes `skill.chain_id`; row-level locked overlay only shows when ALL chains in that tier are locked. `useSkillBuild.ts`: signature updated to `(tier, chainId?) => boolean`.

2. **StatRadarChart domain (FIXED)** — domain expanded from `[0, 50]` to `[0, 70]`. Empirical check: INT/WIS peak at 61.5%, DEX at 60.4%, STR at 54.1%. 50 was clipping real data.

3. **SkillTierChart experimental (VERIFIED)** — `class_0010` (experimental, Yomi) has `tier: null` on all skills, `chain_id: 'flat'` (flat non-tiered structure by design). Correctly excluded by existing `firstTier == null` guard. Caption updated to acknowledge this.

4. **encounter_analytics.json note updated** — reflects gamora Option 2 regen complete (10/10 converged, 849s, 2026-05-16). Tier-1 column coverage assessed: `duration_seconds` only 3.4% of rows (52,800/1,541,700), sparse and uneven (only first 6 balance iterations). Projection stays Damage×WR; `tier1_populated` stays `false`.

**Preview:** https://reincarnated-loadout-odfuct08x-matthew-wetmore-s-projects.vercel.app
**Tag:** `drax/v0.7.1-skill-gate-fix` (commit 68dfceb) — intermediate

### v0.7-encounter-analytics-legends (completed, this session)

All 6 surfaces from dispatch `2026-05-16-drax-encounters-page-explanatory-content.md`:

1. **Surface 1** — `AxisLegend` component: compact strip above each card grid; X/Y axis meanings + ellipse semantics (σ(damage) width, √(WR×(1-WR)) height)
2. **Surface 2** — Sticky view toggle + color legend block (`sticky top-0 z-10 bg-gray-950`); legend reactively switches between encounter-type colors (per-class view) and class colors (per-slot view); subline text makes the semantic change explicit
3. **Surface 3** — `<details open>` "How to read this" panel at page top (6-item structured guide: what/data/good/bad/caveats/analytic-frame); cross-references the View A callout as the analytic frame
4. **Surface 4** — AOE % roster range note above per-class grid (18%–54% for season_001005; verified from encounter_analytics.json)
5. **Surface 5** — View-toggle sublines that update on toggle, calling out color semantics switch
6. **Surface 6** — Tier-1 pending note expanded to full paragraph with "prefer Win Rate as primary signal" guidance

**Build:** Clean (0 TS errors, 686 modules)
**Tag:** `drax/v0.7-encounter-analytics-legends` (commit 3f2fca6) — intermediate
**Preview:** https://reincarnated-loadout-1tj6lewiv-matthew-wetmore-s-projects.vercel.app

### Cycle 11 M4 — attribute_coupling field NOT PRESENT (escalation, 2026-05-25)

**Dispatch:** `agentic_orchestration/dispatches/2026-05-25-drax-cycle-11-m4-attribute-coupling-labels.md`
**Status:** ESCALATED TO KR — field not present in class JSON; merges into star-lord schema extensions dispatch

**Pre-implementation verification result:**
- Searched `attribute_coupling` across all 11 seasons in `reincarnated-loadout/data/` — ZERO matches
- Searched across `reincarnated-engine/` source — ZERO matches
- `ClassData` interface in `src/data/types.ts` — no `attribute_coupling` field
- Sampled class JSON keys from seasons 001001, 001005, 002015, 002328 — field absent in all
- Class JSON top-level keys are: `id`, `name`, `title_completion`, `flavor_text`, `archetype_tag`, `energy_type`, `role_orientation`, `range_profile`, `dominant_element`, `color_palette`, `stat_distribution`, `skills`, `balance_metadata`, `convergence_report` (plus per-season additive fields)

**Conclusion:** drax memo § 4.3 claim "data already present / no schema change needed" was incorrect.
M4 is NOT zero-dependency. It requires star-lord schema extension to emit `attribute_coupling` from the engine.

**Action taken:** NO implementation fired. Per dispatch protocol, escalated to KR for routing to star-lord schema extensions dispatch. Completion record appended to dispatch file.

**No code changed. No tag cut.**

Priority 0 (COMPLETE — Cycle 11 Wave 3b):
- **M3+M6 T4 alteration display:** T4AlterationPanel + T4ComparisonPanel. Tag: `drax/v0.1-cycle-11-m3-m6-t4-display-wave-3b-2026-05-25`
- Preview: https://reincarnated-loadout-bc7s9pqpu-matthew-wetmore-s-projects.vercel.app

Priority 0 (COMPLETE — Cycle 11 Wave 3a):
- **M4 attribute coupling labels:** StatsPanel `Coupled: INT + WIS` display. Tag: `drax/v0.0-cycle-11-m4-attribute-coupling-labels-2026-05-25-refire`

Priority 0 (COMPLETE — Cycle 11 Wave 2):
- **M1/M2/M5 loadout display:** WeaponSlot + OffHandSlot + ProvenanceBadge. Tag: `drax/v0.1-cycle-11-m1-m2-m5-loadout-display-2026-05-25`

Priority 0 (COMPLETE — Phase-1 P1 prior wave):
- **v1.1 website refresh:** 10 new seasons exposed (001005 + 002011-002015), analytics refreshed, season pickers live. Tag: `drax/v1.1-loadout-website-refresh-new-seasons-and-analytics-1`

Priority 1 (READY — D17 Court browser COMPLETE):
- **D17 Court browser: COMPLETE** (tag: `drax/v1.0-d17-court-browser-surface-1`)
- **BLOCKED on rocket:** Court browser is live but shows empty state until rocket ships `export_json()`.
  See MIGRATION.md §v1.2 QUESTION entry. When rocket HANDOFF confirms, replace
  `public/data/court.json` bootstrap with a real export to verify full render path.

Priority 2 (D19 Sub-phase C — next loadout work):
- **D19 Sub-phase C:** Demo VFX wiring (element-keyed routing + geometry-affinity dispatch) + loadout D21 substrate browser + D22 embodiment display + element badges for lightning/holy/shadow
  - Holy wiring UNBLOCKED (CreativeKind Holy Spell Effects on-disk; geometry_animation_map complete)
  - Lightning wiring UNBLOCKED (pimen thunder pack + CreativeKind lightning on-disk; geometry_animation_map complete)
  - Shadow PARTIAL (void_pool only; tendril/creep still gap)
  - Earth stone-VFX fallback available (CraftPix/Fellor deferred to Phase-2)

Priority 3 (Phase-2 followup — DO NOT start in Phase-1 P1):
- CraftPix Premium wood-nature acquisition (earth biological-organic VFX)
- Fellor Crystal Gem acquisition (earth crystal-gem VFX)
- CreativeKind shadow-tendril acquisition (shadow tendril/creep VFX) — not yet authorized

**Cross-seam dependencies to watch:**
- Star-lord D17/D22/D15 manifest schema key naming (QUESTION in hive log line 3382 — coordinate before Sub-phase C VFX wiring)
- Rocket D1 SubstrateIdentity loader (unblocks D22 embodiment display substrate identity consumption)
- Jack-ryan WP-4a: should close with §v1.1 MIGRATION.md entry

**TODO(drax): Frostwindz Deathbringer** — do NOT wire to in-combat VFX. Register CONFIRMED retro-pixel. UI thumbnails ONLY. Guard in both metadata.json and vfx-manifest.json. Explicit gandalf exception required to override DECISION [2026-05-18 00:00Z].

**Outstanding pre-hive open items (unchanged from v0.21):**

### Milestone tag: v0.8-gear-wiring (2026-05-16, Pattern A subagent)

- Matt approved at 2026-05-16 Day 4 mid-session (reviewed preview at https://reincarnated-loadout-g3v3ffhry-matthew-wetmore-s-projects.vercel.app)
- Milestone tag `v0.8-gear-wiring` cut at commit `fe8b810` (the actual feature commit Matt reviewed) and pushed to origin
- **Anomaly noted:** intermediate tag `drax/v0.8-gear-wiring` sits at `72bc4e9` (the subsequent AGENT_STATE update commit), one commit ahead of `fe8b810`. The dispatch specified `fe8b810` as the target — milestone tag placed there as instructed. The two tags do not point to the same commit (unlike v0.7.1 where both tags matched). Raised here for knight-rider awareness; no action taken beyond following dispatch instructions.

### v0.5.1-bug-fixes (completed, this session)

1. **Bug 1 — All legendary**: `synthesizeSampleLoadout.ts` now assigns explicit tiers per display slot (legendary/rare/epic/uncommon/epic/common/rare → all 5 tiers present). Removed `power_score` from fit formula — was tier-correlated and would override tier targets.

2. **Bug 2 — power_score visible**: Removed `Power X.XXX` line from GearGrid modal tooltip.

3. **Bug 3 — raw slot key**: Added `SLOT_TYPE_LABEL` map to GearGrid. Modal now shows "Helmet", "Chest Armor", "Weapon", "Off-Hand", "Necklace", "Ring" instead of internal shorthand ("Head slot", "Main slot").

4. **Bug 4 — gear on /loadout**: Loadout.tsx reverted to `<GearGrid mode="empty" />`. Removed all synthesized gear imports and useMemo.

**Preview:** https://reincarnated-loadout-606gj5w7p-matthew-wetmore-s-projects.vercel.app

## Confirmed findings (additions this session)

- `color_signature`: null for 160/200 items in gear_pool.json (type was `string`, now `string | null`)
- `flavor_text`: null for 120/200 items (was `string`, now `string | null`)
- `visual_prompt`: null for 120/200 items (was `string`, now `string | null`)
- `dominant_element`: null for 126/200 items (was already `string | null` — correct)
- Engine armor pool is flat (slot='armor' only) — no head/chest sub-slot distinction
- `fit_energy_type` keys: combo, focus, mana, rage, stamina-as-resource (energy type names, not element names)
- `ability_modifiers` keys in data: cooldown_factor, energy_cost_factor, crit_bonus_damage, control_duration_bonus (matches MIGRATION.md)
- Stats range: bonus_damage_flat up to 3707; bonus_hp up to 1430; bonus_crit_chance max 0.1 (10%)

## Smoke-test status

✓ TypeScript: `npm run build` — clean (0 errors), 686 modules
✓ Build: dist/ produced, gzip sizes nominal
✓ Vercel preview: READY (68dfceb) — https://reincarnated-loadout-odfuct08x-matthew-wetmore-s-projects.vercel.app

### Cycle 14 Dispatch A — Vocabulary lock redactions (completed 2026-05-27)

**Dispatch:** `agentic_orchestration/dispatches/2026-05-27-drax-dispatch-a-vocabulary-lock-redactions.md`
**Authority:** Matt 2026-05-27 verbatim ratification "RATIFY IMMEDIATE"; KR fired sub-agent
**Build result:** tsc -b clean + vite build clean (866 modules; chunk size warning pre-existing)

**What landed:**

5 originally catalogued #45 player-facing violations + 11 additional player-facing violations discovered during grep audit:

- `src/pages/Analytics.tsx:30` — `StatBadge label="Classes"` → `label="Kits"`
- `src/pages/Encounters.tsx:454` — button label "Per-class" → "Per-kit"
- `src/pages/Encounters.tsx:469` — description string "Each card = one class" → "Each card = one kit"
- `src/pages/Encounters.tsx:470` — description string "classes' performance... color = class" → "kits' performance... color = kit"
- `src/pages/Pitch.tsx:22` — `{ label: 'Classes', value: 55 }` STAT entry removed entirely (Q-DA-1 judgment: stale hardcoded count; page is interim pending Dispatch C /summary re-arch)
- `src/pages/Encounters.tsx:348` — subtitle `classes ·` → `kits ·`
- `src/pages/Encounters.tsx:355` — "class efficiency" → "kit efficiency" (tier-1 pending note)
- `src/pages/Encounters.tsx:370-371` — "how one class performs... per-class view... every class performs" → "per-kit view" variants
- `src/pages/Encounters.tsx:377` — "(11 classes · 22 encounter slots). Each (class × monster)" → kits variants
- `src/pages/Encounters.tsx:383-384` — "AOE classes... non-AOE classes" → kits variants (good-looks panel)
- `src/pages/Encounters.tsx:388,390` — "classes win or lose... zero spread across classes" → kits variants (bad-looks panel)
- `src/pages/Encounters.tsx:418-419,423,428` — "AOE classes... single-target classes... AOE classes" → kits variants (design interpretation callout)
- `src/pages/Encounters.tsx:435` — "classes have at least one encounter slot" → "kits have..."
- `src/pages/Encounters.tsx:488` — "fraction of class's skill kit" → "fraction of the kit's skills"

**Grep audit result:** CLEAN. Remaining "class" occurrences in these files are all exempt:
- `className=` attributes (Tailwind CSS)
- `class_0001`…`class_0011` key literals (internal data identifiers)
- `CLASS_COLORS`, `classCards`, `flaggedClassCount`, `ClassLegend`, `classIds` (internal TypeScript identifiers)
- `ViewMode = 'class'`, `view === 'class'`, `setView('class')` (internal state values, never rendered)
- JSX comments (not player-facing)
- Pitch.tsx lines 83/85/110 — narrative prose about engine capabilities ("class names" as engine output feature description, "Dungeon-of-Exile-class" quality comparison idiom); narrative output exemption applies per Discipline #45 canonical

**Q-DA-1 resolution:** removed stale "Classes: 55" stat entry from Pitch.tsx STATS array. Count was hardcoded, stale by construction, page is interim pending Dispatch C.

**Q-DA-2 resolution:** "Kits" used throughout. "Per-kit" for toggle button (parallel with "Per-encounter-slot"). Single-target/AOE qualifiers preserved as archetype descriptors.

## Session: cascade-r4 follow-on — /loadout + /sample Cycle 14 extension (2026-05-29)

**Commit:** `ea7795e` — "loadout: cascade-r4 v1-close — Cycle 14 kit identity browser on Loadout + Sample pages"
**Tag:** `drax/v1.0-cascade-r4-v1-close-loadout-sample-pages-extension-1` (pushed to origin)
**Push:** `764cbbe..ea7795e` pushed to `origin/main`
**Live bundle:** `index-DTt_mltz.js` (confirmed via curl; 878 modules, 0 TS errors, 81 tests pass)

### What landed

New component `src/components/Cycle14/Cycle14LoadoutSection.tsx`:
- Cycle 14 v1 kit identity browser rendered below existing content on `/loadout` and `/sample`
- Tabbed 3-season view (Season 001 / 002 / 003) with faction cluster tiles + per-kit names + narratives
- Reuses `FactionClusterTile` from /pitch — no new tile component needed
- Explicit skill-tree deferred note + data gap note with star-lord routing target
- TODO(drax) annotations in component + Loadout.tsx + Sample.tsx

### Data-emission gap surfaced to KR

**Gap:** Cycle 14 seasons have no `manifest.json` + `classes/*.json` in the loadout bundle.
Skill tree integration for `/loadout` and `/sample` requires star-lord to emit per-season
class artifacts. Until then, the Cycle14LoadoutSection placeholder stands.

**KR routing target:** star-lord — emit `data/cycle-14-wave-5-season-{001,002,003}/manifest.json`
and `data/cycle-14-wave-5-season-{001,002,003}/classes/*.json` for `useSeasonData` glob.

**When it lands:** remove `Cycle14LoadoutSection` from both pages. The new seasons will
auto-appear in the season picker via existing `useSeasonData` glob logic.

## Session: cascade-r4 v1 session-end — adapter cleanup (2026-05-30)

**Commit:** `d97462f` — "drax(loadout): drop cycle14Adapter — surface real star-lord engine emission across all pages"
**Tag:** `drax/v1.0-cascade-r4-v1-session-end-adapter-cleanup-1` (pushed to origin)
**Push:** `32053b9..d97462f` pushed to `origin/main`
**Vercel deploy:** `dpl_DSsWYePohEWkm3EsMwSHBaettY2o` — Production Ready ~1min build

### What landed

KR-deferred cleanup after star-lord landed manifest.json + classes/*.json for Cycle 14 Wave 5
seasons (158 class files, 3 manifests; commit `fd4c0ae` loadout side).

**Removed:**
- `src/data/cycle14Adapter.ts` — 319-line drax-side bridge, entirely deleted
- `useSeasonData.ts` lines 4-7 (CYCLE14_SEASON_DATA import + comment block)
- `useSeasonData.ts` lines 67-73 (injection loop + comment)
- `isCycle14AdapterSeason` variable in `Loadout.tsx` and `Sample.tsx`
- Violet "engine-emission pending" banner block in `Loadout.tsx` and `Sample.tsx`
- `TODO(star-lord)` annotations in `Loadout.tsx`, `Sample.tsx`, `useSeasonData.ts`

**Updated:**
- Placeholder banner in `Loadout.tsx` + `Sample.tsx`: consolidated to single amber banner
  reading "Skills are substrate-derived placeholders" — applies correctly to both Cycle 13
  and Cycle 14 Wave 5 (placeholder_skill_content: true in all real manifests)
- Banner text updated: now accurately states "balance metadata (win rates, quality vectors,
  cohort) are real engine output" — true for Cycle 14 real emission

### Glob auto-discovery confirmed

Cycle 14 seasons load via existing `../../data/*/manifest.json` glob:
- `cycle-14-wave-5-season-001` → 54 class files, manifest_version=cycle14-v1
- `cycle-14-wave-5-season-002` → 53 class files, manifest_version=cycle14-v1
- `cycle-14-wave-5-season-003` → 51 class files, manifest_version=cycle14-v1

### Data-contract notes (Cycle 14 real emission)

Per MIGRATION.md §v1.67:
- `balance_metadata.actual_winrate` populated (gauntlet_pass_rate from kit_archive.db)
- `balance_metadata.quality_vector` populated ([q1..q5] from phase4_archive_insertion)
- `balance_metadata.cohort` populated (phase7 verdict)
- `balance_metadata.final_modifier` / `convergence_iterations` / `converged` — null (no convergence loop)
- `skills` — single placeholder per kit; phase5_is_placeholder=true (Cycle 15+ full gen required)
- `gearPool` — empty array (no gear_instance_generator run for Cycle 14 wave-5)
- `range_profile` vocab: `melee`/`mid`/`ranged` (differs from legacy `close`/`medium`/`long`) — both string, no TS issue

### Remaining TODO(drax) tracked

- Yomi gear_pool fallback in useSeasonData.ts — remove when engine ships gear_pool.json for new seasons
- placeholder banner on /loadout + /sample — remove `isPlaceholderSeason` banner when Cycle 15+ full
  skill gen runs for Cycle 14 seasons (placeholder_skill_content will be false or absent)
